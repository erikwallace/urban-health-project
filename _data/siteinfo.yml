  intern_quote:
    <p>&ldquo;This summer, I had the opportunity to learn about the different roles in Bethany House and learn about the process of obtaining shelter for a person experiencing homelessness.   There are many different programs for the varying needs of Cincinnati&apos;s homeless community, and the obstacles our clients face are numerous. From transportation, child care, counseling, pregnancy, legal, relationships, and more there is so much that must be coordinated in order to become stable.  In my role at Bethany House, I had the opportunity to intake new clients into shelter. In this role, I had to ask a lot of questions about their financial and personal lives in order to determine how we can best assist them. This was a great opportunity to practice building a rapport and being sensitive to the experiences of our clients. Through this, I had the opportunity to directly learn about trauma-informed care. Clients often struggle with basic tasks and interactions due to the trauma that they are dealing with. As care providers, it is important to meet clients where they are at. We cannot expect them to act differently, and we must provide as much assistance as possible given the situation.&rdquo;</p>

  site_description: <p>Every year, Catholic Charities Southwestern Ohio provides counseling and support to approximately 250 international refugees of all faiths as they settle in the Greater Cincinnati area. From the moment the refugees step off of a plane, Catholic Charities Southwestern Ohio takes responsibility for meeting their basic needs for food, clothing, housing, household goods, furniture, medical care, and transportation as well as for helping them in becoming self-sufficient and integrated in their new society. Additional services provided include case management to ensure that health screenings and insurance paperwork are completed; assistance with obtaining Social Security cards, food stamps, and a medical card; and orientation workshops to aid in acculturation and adjustment to community life. The program goals place an emphasis on obtaining permanent employment, developing a career path, attaining self-sufficiency, and reuniting with family members. The program continues to offer help indefinitely as long as refugees require it through acculturation, employment, career, and counseling services. The Urban Health Project intern provides much needed assistance in day-to-day operations and projects, especially as they relate to medical needs and concerns.</p>

  intern_quote:
      <p>&ldqu;While at Catholic Charities of Southwestern Ohio I spent my time working with their Refugee Youth Mentoring Program. I was able to work with our youth clients throughout the summer to assist with various tasks including filling out the FAFSA, navigating the college admissions process, applying for jobs, learning how to take the bus to and from specific locations, getting state and federal benefits, and much more. We also spent a lot of time working with our clients to identify goals they had for their future, and then building plans for the steps that needed to be taken to reach those goals. We also had opportunities throughout the summer to enjoy more relaxed, casual time with our youth clients. This included going to a movie and playing soccer. Through these types of events I felt I was better able to build relationships with the clients and get to know them on a more personal level, which was valuable in helping to identify their goals and dreams for the future.</p>
      <p>Another aspect of the Refugee Youth Mentoring Program is recruiting mentors for the youth clients. These mentors then work with the clients either one on one or in a group setting. Throughout the summer I was a part of the meetings where we introduced some of our youth clients to new mentors. These meetings were important to build rapport and trust between the client and mentors so that the mentoring pair could be effective. Additionally, we had afternoon group mentor meetings where clients had the opportunity to come and meet with mentors to discuss a wide variety of topics. For example, at one mentoring meeting we had a presentation on potential careers in the nursing field. These meetings enabled a more consistent connection between our clients and mentors, which I felt was incredibly valuable.</p>
      <p>I also spent time assisting with preparing for the new arrival of a few clients from other countries to the United States. Most of this work involved moving furniture and cleaning new apartments for the new arrivals so that they were set up with everything they needed once they arrived.</p>
      <p>Throughout my time with CCSWOH, I gained a lot of insight into social determinants that impact our client's ability to access various resources, including healthcare. Language barriers and lack of transportation were huge factors in our clients' lives that influenced how they interacted with not only the healthcare system, but also how they were able to access state benefits, and how they were able to access jobs in the workforce.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;his summer working for the Center for Closing The Health Gap I gained valuable insights into the community that I will use in my future career as a physician. The summer was a mix of virtual and in person experiences. Most of the virtual experiences included me doing data analysis on previous initiatives the Health Gap had performed. I also researched the literature regarding different topics such as delivering needs assessment and survey questions for minority communities. I also created Diabetes informational pamphlets that the Health Gap is utilizing in an initiative this fall. The in-person experiences included Friday Healthy Food events, survey recruitment, and participating in the Scholar House Health Fair.</p>
    <p>The Friday food event is an initiative the Health Gap participated in that helped promote healthy eating. Each Friday the Health Gap would set up a table at the Old Kroger in Walnut Hills and would provide information and healthy snacks to those who stopped by. Other organizations also had tables and the Healthy Mobile Market was the main feature where people in the community could purchase fresh fruits and vegetables. At this event I mainly offered the healthy snack of the week, whether that was rice cakes and peanut butter, or turkey wraps, and I spoke with the different community members that stopped by. I also would administer a survey to the participants in order to gain interest in other events and to see if the events the Health Gap was putting on were worthwhile in the eyes of the community. At these events I was able to have casual conversations with many people in the community, who shared personal stories on how eating healthy and promoting those in their families and friend circles to eat healthy has changed their lives. They also shared how difficult this can be, because of the food desert Walnut Hills is located in, and the lack of resources many members of the community have to fresh fruits and vegetables. These events made a huge impact on my summer because they gave me first-hand experience interacting with community members and getting to hear what is needed for them to live a healthier life.</p>
    <p>The Scholar House health Fair was also an impactful part of my summer, where I helped deliver a needs assessment to the women who lived within the scholar House and then I also analyzed the data in order to create a plan for initiatives the Health Gap can implement in the future to positively impact the residents. I learned how important gaining the trust of the residents is in administering a survey and asking sensitive questions, but when I did, how open the residents were in sharing what most would benefit them. Building this rapport is a skill I hope to use in my future career as a physician.</p>
    <p>Overall this summer gave me meaningful insight on how to impact those around me; by simply listening to the needs of others.&rdquo;</p>

  site_name: Former Site&#58; Center for Addiction Treatment
  site_description: <p>The Center for Addiction Treatment (CAT) has been serving the Cincinnati community for over 40 years by providing professional help for adults with addictions. The program serves approximately 1,000 individuals every year, a majority of who have opiate addictions. Their community-based detoxification program is a medically monitored program with both nurses and physicians involved in the process of helping clients overcome withdrawal from their addictions. In addition to offering this residential detoxification program, CAT also provides many other services to its clients to help them on the road to recovery. For those waiting to get into the residential detoxification track, CAT offers a pre-treatment program involving support and counseling. CAT also provides short-term residential treatment, family programming to rebuild connections, and aftercare to provide support for those in recovery. Although over half of the clients at CAT are aged 18 to 45, they offer a unique program that provides education targeted towards individuals who are above the age of 50 and seeking help to recover from their addictions. Additionally, CAT has an on-site primary care office, Monarch Primary Care. Anyone can be seen there, but the office specializes in primary care for patients with a history of addiction, and their care takes into account the unique needs of such patients. The Urban Health Project intern at this site is given the opportunity to participate in all aspects of the recovery process to gain a better understanding of addictions and the difficulties involved in overcoming them.</p>

  site_description: <p>City Gospel Mission is an organization which works with men experiencing homelessness. While residents, the men are provided with financial counseling, job training, assistance in finding jobs, day program classes, shelter, and three meals a day. All the efforts of the mission are focused towards moving the men into positive housing, and each resident is assigned a case worker to help them work towards that goal. City Gospel Mission also works closely with their two addiction recovery programs, Having the Courage to Change and Exodus, in order to offer services to residents battling addiction. Other partners included Jobs Plus, a local employment agency, and the Lord's Gym, a nonprofit, low cost gym with programs offered to the residents.</p>

  intern_quote:
    <p>&ldquo;uring my internship, I spent the first week or so just hanging out at the front desk, speaking with the staff, learning how to answer the phones, getting to know some of the residents, sitting in on some of the Day Program classes, and generally getting familiar with the flow of the shelter. My favorite memory of the first two weeks was helping one of the residents, whom I had gotten to know, move into his new apartment in OTR.</p>
    <p>Starting in week three, and continuing until the end of the program, I worked on a small study to investigate the relationship between an individual’s level of spirituality and their success in finding stable housing outside of the shelter. I spent a lot of time interviewing the 25 residents that were willing to participate. Just speaking with the residents and hearing their stories was one of the highlights of my summer experience.</p>
    <p>During the latter end of the summer, when I wasn’t working on my study, I spent my time working the front desk, answering many interesting and unique phone calls, helping with donations, answering resident’s questions, and doing anything else that the staff needed. Also, I was fortunate to spend a day working on the Jobs Van. The Jobs Van is a program where a CGM staff drives around the city and offers panhandlers compensation for a half-day’s work picking up trash on the side of the streets. The participants are given $45, a free hot lunch, as well as connections with resources. I learned a lot working with thez participants that day.</p>
    <p>Overall, I had a very interesting and unique summer with City Gospel Mission. I learned a ton from the staff as well as the residents, and these lessons will stick with me for the rest of my career.&rdquo;ing to the needs of others.&rdquo;</p>

  intern_quote:
    <p>&ldquo;his summer, we were tasked with completing a chart review of Crossroad patients who had recently utilized the Emergency Department (ED). These patients received their primary care from one of five Crossroad Sites in Cincinnati - Over-the-Rhine, Crossroad-Harrison, Crossroad-West, Taft School-Based Health Center, or Rothenberg School-Based Health Center. They were seen at one of many emergency departments in the greater Cincinnati area.</p>
    <p>The Crossroad team has noticed over the years that many of their patients overuse the ED or rely on the ED for their primary care instead of Crossroad services. This project sought to understand trends in emergency department utilization in order to better counsel Crossroad patients on proper ED use. We were interested in a number of factors, including patient demographics (age, neighborhood, predisposing health factors, and which Crossroad site was their "home" site) and characteristics of their ED visit (their chief complaint, whether they sought help from Crossroad first, whether they were hospitalized, whether follow-up was needed, and how long it had been since they were in touch with Crossroad). Our hope was to use this data to provide insight on who was inappropriately using the ED and why patients were choosing to use the ED over Crossroad to adjust Crossroad resources to better meet the needs of their patients. Overall, we sought to strengthen the relationship between Crossroad physicians and their patients while improving long-term patient outcomes.</p>
    <p>Through this project, I benefited from a great deal of tangible experience that I will carry with me throughout the rest of my medical school journey and into my career as a physician. Primarily, I am thankful for the chance to work directly with an organization such as Crossroad that serves the Cincinnati community so faithfully. I feel I learned a great deal about public health and the social determinants of health, and I hope to use this knowledge to break down the barriers to health that my own patients face (whether those be due to language, income, immigration status, health education, health access, or something different). I was also thankful to learn more about clinical research and hone skills such as efficient chart review and data analysis which will be vital to my future career goals of incorporating public health research into a clinical practice in primary care.</p>
    <p>Overall, I feel this project was a huge success and I am grateful to have been offered this opportunity through UHP. I hope UHP continues to partner with Crossroad in the future, and I can't wait to hear about all the great change that such a partnership continues to foster.&rdquo;ing to the needs of others.&rdquo;</p>

  site_description: <p>The Alzheimer's Association is a national organization whose mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease, to provide care and support for those affected, and to reduce the risk of dementia. There are over 100 chapters, including one in Cincinnati that serves 27 counties in Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. They provide countless programs and services free of charge to community members provided by a staff of nurses, social workers, and volunteers. These include support groups, care consultations, educational programs, and enrichment events such as art and music. There are also significant fundraising efforts to support these programs as well as to fund research for a cure. These efforts include the Walk to End Alzheimer's, the Longest Day, and A Reason to Hope.</p>
    <p>A few years ago, the clinical team at the Greater Cincinnati chapter created the NextSteps program so providers would have an efficient way to "refer" their patients and caregivers to the free programs and services that the Association provides. In 2018, the UHP interns at the Association provided outreach to physicians offices about this program as well as others that the Alzheimer's Association offers.</p>

  site_name: Former Site&#58; Lighthouse New Beginnings
  site_description: <p>Lighthouse Youth Services has provided services for abused and neglected children and for families in crisis since 1969. Through foster homes, group homes, residential treatment centers, supervised apartments, and other residential programs, Lighthouse serves hundreds of individuals each day. The organization is made up of a number of programs including Lighthouse New Beginnings. This arm of the organization is a therapeutic group home setting for adolescent girls ages 12 through 18 who have been victims of physical and sexual abuse and/or have emotional and behavioral problems. Growing up in low-income communities with substandard housing, most of the teenagers come from neglectful and/or abusive families. During the summer, the Urban Health Project (UHP) intern works with program staff to help these teens explore their future dreams and goals and to expose them to a variety of career choices and the many educational/vocational opportunities available to them in our community. The Summer Work Program at Lighthouse Community School Garden is an optional program for residents that aims to establish a controlled environment in which they can learn the important skills necessary to prepare them to enter the work force. UHP interns supervise teens on college tours and field trips to places such as hospitals, factories, and the Newport Aquarium. The teens will observe the possibilities offered by careers in fields such as medicine, nursing, marine biology, law, and mechanical work.</p>

  intern_quote:
    <p>&ldquo;My experience was awesome, challenging, and completely perspective-changing. Each day I was present at Mecum House was spent working directly with the teenage clients alongside the youth workers. Duties of my position included supporting the staff during morning wake-up and breakfast routines, participating in and facilitating activities with the residents (crafts, card games, video games, watching TV, doing hair, talking through situations, etc.), assisting residents with job applications, maintaining supervision and safety amongst the teens, completing intakes and discharges, answering the phone, and completing paperwork and shift notes along with the staff. Additional experiences I had through the summer were joining staff and residents on outings to places like the Cincinnati Zoo, and accompanying residents to emergent medical appointments. I absolutely loved the facility and residents, and I grew significantly in my understanding of the social services system. Pertinent to my medical education and career, I became acutely aware of how social determinants of health present amongst teenagers in the social services system. The housing-first model of addressing homelessness was a concept I already supported, but my reasons for wanting to push forward initiatives in this field were bolstered by my experiences this summer. The biggest barrier to each of the residents almost universally was a lack of stability. Mecum House provided a temporary reprieve, but quite literally serves as a transition point between ideally more stable placements. To expect anyone, particularly a child, to have a strong understanding and motivation to make choices that are in their best health interest when they aren&apos;t completely sure where they will be a day from now shows a gap in our approach to patient health education. Before asking ourselves &ldquo;why won&apos;t this person comply with their medications,&rdquo; we need to be asking &ldquo;Does this person know where they will be living next week.&rdquo;ing to the needs of others.&rdquo;</p>

  site_description: <p>Cradle Cincinnati was formed in 2013 by a collaboration of partners determined to address and improve the heartrending infant mortality rate of Hamilton County. Recognizing that this issue is complex and intricately intertwined within a diversity of beliefs and social environments, they employ a model of "collective impact" in their undertaking of the matter.  It is within this paradigm that the organization actively collaborates with widespread partners and the community as a whole to address the various aspects of this multifaceted issue. Calculated as the death of live-born babies before the age of one per 1,000 live births, the infant mortality rate for Hamilton County from 2013-2017 was 8.981. While this is a strong improvement from the previous 5 years (10.24), our community remains among the worst 10% in the country. The infant mortality rate is not only distressing because it represents the loss of a child in the community, but it also signifies the overall health of society. As such, it is clear to Cradle Cincinnati that there is still much to be done.</p>
    <p>In June of 2018, Cradle Cincinnati released their new 5-year strategic plan for reducing preterm birth and infant  mortality. Moving forward, the partners will be coming together to implement various methods to reach their 3 major goals over the next 5 years:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Reduce the number of babies born before the end of the second trimester by 33% by 2023, bringing us to the national average.</li>
    <li>Eliminate sleep-related infant deaths in Hamilton County by 2023.</li>
    <li>Promote what we know about reducing birth defects and lead the way on new scientific discovery to better understand congenital anomalies.</li>
    </ol>

  intern_quote:
    <p>&ldquo;This summer, I had a lot of exposure to the organization of Cradle Cincinnati. I attended weekly team meetings with the whole organization, and attended meetings with different divisions and teams of Cradle Cincinnati, which allowed me to see all of the various ways the organization works, and allowed me to be as involved as I wanted to be depending on what interested me. I met with my supervisor weekly to recap my work, discuss goals and direction, and to check in on my project. My primary project was the Zip Code profiles I made on the priority zip codes in Cradle Cincinnati and their infant mortality, maternal health, socioeconomics, and health statistics. As I attended webinars, meetings, and spoke to people working at Cradle, more things caught my eye, and I became more involved in various projects with the organization. Spanning from event planning, to grant one pagers, to Reproductive Life Plan booklets, the deeper into the summer I went, the more independence and freedom I had to work on whatever interested me, and to engage with the various teams at Cradle.&rdquo;ing to the needs of others.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My summer experience went amazing. I loved the opportunity to work with children and get to know them while also doing academic enrichment and fun field trips. When signing up for UHP this was exactly the type of summer project/experience that I was looking for. After completing the summer I loved my experience and wouldn&apos;t have wanted to do anything else. Each day we started summer camp with the children with moving in the morning. We then did breakfast and then we did academic enrichment or swimming lessons. In the afternoon we had lunch and then had a fun activity planned for the evening. Throughout the summer we spent a lot of time with the children and really got to know them.&rdquo;</p>

  intern_quote:
    <p>&ldquo;At first, I admit to being unsure of working at Tender Mercies and the benefits it would have on me.  I am passionate about advocating for those with mental illness and reducing the stigma wherever I can about it.  In a tale as old as time, however, I really grew attached to those I worked with and found myself more and more comfortable just having normal interactions with them.  I was not, honestly, as worried as I thought I would be, as I found it to be perfectly natural on most occasions.  On my first day interacting with the residents, I fixed a bunch of their electronics on accident and listened to someone just talk for an hour.  I find I did that a lot, listen to people talk who I now realize probably don&apos;t have anyone else to listen to them.  It&apos;s tragic listening to some people&apos;s life stories, and it&apos;s also amazing how unbelievably smart and talented some residents are- indeed, mental illness and intelligence are not always correlated.</p>
    <p>I think the largest challenge I had to deal with was lack of participation in my activities that I planned.  Taking inspiration from the intern last year, I set up (socially distanced) group activities for people to join in, such as group walks and arts and crafts.  I also set up a blood pressure station for those who wanted to get it taken and have that information, and I distributed Covid-19 vaccine information in an attempt to increase vaccination rates.  These are a few examples of the many projects upon which I embarked.  Some of this worked well, but only a couple of people, for example, joined the group walks.  After speaking to a lot of residents and staff, some can be attributed to the nature of the mental illness that makes some unwilling to join any activities, and some is the result of Covid-19 restrictions building sedentary habits.</p>
    <p>The greatest benefit I gained from this opportunity was the boldness and self confidence to be able to approach and work with people who may have debilitating mental illness.  I do not claim to understand all there is to know about mental illness, but I do claim to have a better grasp at meeting these people where they are at and being more capable of being a partner with them on improving their healthcare when I do finally have a patient with these struggles.  I always say that having a mental illness is similar to having a broken leg- the only difference is that society treats worse the one it cannot understand or see on an X-ray.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Every monday evening I worked as a medical assistant at Belterra racetrack clinic. My duties included checking-in patients, coordinating financial assistance and transportation to referral appointments, filing paperwork, and practicing clinical skills with patients. I would describe my role as similar to a medical assistant. I also had duties throughout the week in making sure the clinic was running smoothly such as inputting patient encounters into the medical record system and picking up patient medications. I also planned and coordinated a health fair at the racetrack clinic at the end of my internship. My other main role was to update UC family medicine&apos;s homeless resource guide, map, and app. I made phone calls to area agencies on the app to ensure contact information and services offered were up to date. I inputted these changes into the three platforms and sent the updated guides to all the area agencies.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Working with LifeCenter has truly been an eye-opening experience. I came in knowing little-to-nothing about organ, eye and tissue donation.Though I am a registered donor, it wasn&apos;t until I interned with LifeCenter, that I knew what it really meant to be a donor. This summer, I learned about the rampant misinformation being spread regarding organ donation, and the best ways in which to tackle it. Hearing from donor recipients, donor families, and all those touched by donation, I learned how powerful the gift of donation can be. Because there are so many myths surrounding donation, we tend not to focus on the benefits of being a registered donor, and the power you have to save someone&apos;s life. Working with Audrey Holtzman, the Community Outreach Educator at LifeCenter has provided me first-hand experience of what it means to know and live in the community you serve. So many of our outreach initiatives were possible because Mrs. Holtzman was so well-connected to the community. This is a quality that is so important to the work we do as healthcare providers, and helps build trust and bridge gaps between healthcare workers and community members. My experience with LifeCenter has shaped how I view my role in society and I am grateful I had the opportunity to spend my summer serving the community through Urban Health Project.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I enjoyed my summer experience working with groundwork immensely! I found the work extremely rewarding and I loved being able to me active, work alongside and mentor kids, whilst also working  to make the world a better place. My summer experience started out with me hitting the ground running, which was fun to just be able to learn on the fly with the stakes being rather low in comparison to medicine, but after the first week or so it was really nice being more comfortable working with the kids and tending to the environmental needs of Cincinnati! After the "orientation" phase it even got better because we began putting in place the enhancement days were the kids got to go out into the community and do something truly impactful to them; it was super rewarding watching the kids light up every time we would go to some interesting location and they got to experience something like being on a boat for the first time, I really just loved every second of it!&rdquo;</p>

I learned about the intricacies of Medicaid and how to ensure patients receive coverage so they may be treated no matter their circumstance. I was able to familiarize myself with patient health data and how to properly provide it in a confidential manner to help the clinic best address its most common health concerns.

In addition to learning more about how the clinic operates, I played an active role in assisting in various administrative capacities when there were short-staffed needs.

  site_name: Former Site&#58; CHECK Foster Care Clinic
  site_description: <p>The CHECK pilot program started in January of 2012 as a clinic designated solely to evaluate and help children in foster care. There are 19,000 children in foster care in Ohio and 2,100 children in foster care in Hamilton County, many of whom have suffered child abuse and neglect. Within 5 days of placement, these children come for their state-mandated doctor&#39;s visit. They are evaluated for abuse and neglect, checked for communicable diseases, and any needs of the foster parent are addressed. Within 30 days of their placement, the children come back for a comprehensive evaluation, including mental health, developmental status, vision/hearing screening, and any immunizations they need. The child is referred to services that can assist them, and a primary care physician is identified and established. Starting in September 2012, CHECK Foster Care Clinic will see every child entering the foster care system in Hamilton County.</p>

  intern_quote:
    <p>&ldquo;My summer internship with UHP and CCHMC was an incredible experience and I am so grateful to have been able to participate in a number of exciting projects.</p>
    <p>Most of my summer was involved with the Pediatric Patient & Family Advisory Council (PFAC) study in collaboration with CCHMC and the Institute for Patient & Family Centered Care (IPFCC). PFACs are focus-group/committee organizations composed of patients, family members, and hospital staff such as physicians and nurses, child life staff, and others. Since the literature on these groups, particularly in children's hospitals, is limited, we sought to explore the current landscape of PFACs across the country. Over the summer we surveyed and subsequently interviewed 12 children's hospital PFAC representatives to gain insight into recruitment strategies, DEI efforts, COVID transition successes/challenges, and other areas. It was such a pleasure speaking with these PFAC representatives, and I learned so much about the importance of PFACs and the impact that they can have in offering a platform and a voice for patients and families. After completing the interviews this summer, I plan to stay involved during the fall with the analysis and final report that will ultimately be published for the broader field.</p>
    <p>During the summer I also attended weekly COVID-19 meetings related to a variety of different topics, such as COVID-19 vaccination rates as well as case counts given the surge of the Delta variant. Through these meetings I learned about many unique strategies that were being built to increase vaccination rates, such as holding various community events, vaccine ambassador events, and offering the COVID vaccine in pediatric clinics for parents and family members in addition to eligible patients. The team and I came up with the idea to create a slide deck that would include COVID-19/vaccine FAQs to be shared on the TV screens at the community clinic. The slide deck included common FAQS and I also included QR codes to short Youtube videos created by Cincinnati Children's addressing different COVID/vaccine concerns. This was an exciting project and I enjoyed thinking of creative ways to best share my research in a way that would be accessible and informative.</p>
    <p>One final experience I'd like to share was the very unique opportunity I had to attend Cincinnati’s inaugural Children and Families Cabinet meeting downtown at City Hall. People of all backgrounds and expertise came together and we did an exercise looking at issues of health, culture and societal exposure, career opportunities, housing, and safety pertaining to children. This was a really cool experience and I look forward to hearing more about the development of this new cabinet in the future!</p>

It is the only non-profit hospice provider in Cincinnati. HOC provides care for patients who are considered terminal and are expected to live six months or less if their disease follows its natural course. Many patients outlive this, and HOC ensures that patients are comfortable and that they experience the best quality of life possible. There are a wide variety of services offered by HOC, including medical and palliative care, social work, spiritual care, and non-traditional therapies.  A team of physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, home health aides, and volunteers all work to ensure that the patient&#39;s needs are being met. HOC provides care for patients in their homes, whether that is a traditional house or a long-term care facility. In addition, patients have the ability to stay short-term in one of the four inpatient units to address acute problems or to give caregivers a break. HOC is also affiliated with the Goldstein Family Grief Center and Fernside, which provide grief support for both adults and children.</p>

  job_description:
    <p>Because HOC is such a complex organization, it is necessary that the intern spend the beginning of the internship completing orientations and shadowing employees in different disciplines. These opportunities include shadowing physicians, nurses, social workers, and chaplains both in homecare and in the inpatient units. The intern will also attend Interdisciplinary Group Meetings to witness how the team comes together to ensure that the patients&#39; needs are met all on fronts. HOC is also very involved in the community, and the intern will get the opportunity to go to presentations and community seminars with the marketing department. The remainder of the time is spent in the main office in Blue Ash. The education department oversees all of the various departments and disciplines, and the intern will spend time there both learning more about the intricacies of the organization and helping out with ongoing projects.   He/she will gain valuable knowledge about end-of-life care and palliative medicine that will be useful no matter which specialty of medicine they choose to pursue.</p>

  site_name: Former Site&#58; St. Elizabeth Pendleton County
  site_description: <p>St. Elizabeth Healthcare has served the Greater Cincinnati region since 1861. Consisting of multi-specialty sites throughout Ohio, Indiana, and Northern Kentucky, St. E&#39;s has supported, provided care for, and loved its community since the Covington Sisters of the Poor founded it 150 years ago. Now, over 300 doctors make up the St. Elizabeth network. One such physician, Dr. Brian Schack, is a family practitioner/pediatrician in Pendleton, Kentucky.</p><p>Dr. Schack sees thousands of patients a year, over a hundred a week, with all kinds of needs - all at a rural office with scandalously few resources, in desperate need itself. The Pendleton branch of St. Elizabeth lacks finances, supplies, sufficient staff, and - most importantly - a voice responsive to its needs. Dr. Schack does everything he can to take care of his office, to care for his patients, but with limited outside assistance.</p><p>In an attempt to compensate for such limited assistance, Dr. Schack is following a novel but nation-wide trend in primary care. The "Team Model" was created to help primary care offices everywhere, yet particularly those lacking manpower, funding, and other resources.</p><p>The model utilizes a rotating set of medical assistants cross-trained to help in more areas than typically practiced. The medical assistants (MA) would see patients before the physician, discuss reasons for the visit, update charts, and advise patients on more standard medical concerns. The MA then remains in the room upon the physician&#39;s entrance to act as a scribe and provide a sense of care continuity for the patient. When the physician has finished his/her exam, the MA remains in the room to ensure full patient understanding and comfort. This is followed up with phone calls post-visit to check in between stops at the office.</p><p>All of this is done with whole patient wellbeing in mind. The emphasis is on human-to-human care, addressing patient needs inside and out. It&#39;s difficult with minimal resources to provide adequate healthcare, but St. E&#39;s believes it takes more than money to truly care for a patient. Dr. Schack&#39;s Pendleton office is out to do just that.</p>

  site_name: Former Site&#58; The Center for Respite Care
  site_description: <p>The Cincinnati/Hamilton County Continuum of Care for the Homeless reports that on any given night, more than 1,300 homeless individuals are forced to sleep in shelters and on the streets of Greater Cincinnati. Substandard living conditions, inadequate nutrition, extreme weather and limited healthcare inevitably lead to serious health conditions. The Center for Respite Care attempts to address these issues by providing shelter and care to those who are both ill and homeless. The Center for Respite Care is a 14-bed, 24-hour facility providing medical and nursing care to sick homeless people to promote effective healing. Clients receive quality medical care and assistance in breaking the cycle of homelessness. Since opening in 2003, the Center for Respite Care has cared for over 1000 sick and injured people who are homeless. The collaborative efforts of many health care and homeless service providers allow the Center for Respite Care to be an important link in the transition from homelessness for many people. Illness or injury does not have to disrupt a homeless person&#39;s progress toward self-sufficiency. By offering appropriate care and referral of patients to post-recovery treatment and/or housing, the Respite is an important bridge enabling people without homes to begin or continue on the path to independent living in permanent housing.</p>
