<p>This summer, I worked at the Center for Closing the Health Gap in Greater Cincinnati. I spent majority of my summer working on a manuscript, which was a quality improvement study about their Do Right! Nutrition Train the Trainer program. We plan to submit it to a public health education journal article that way people who plan to create future nutrition education for low income African Americans can look at what we did and our results and consider implementing some aspects of our intervention into theirs. It has been helpful to get more research experience, and the Ph.D. at my site did a fantastic job of helping me to improve my writing. I will have to continue working on the revisions during the school year, but it will be nice to have a publication under my belt.</p>
<p>I also worked on some random tasks for my community site before I settled on a project. I wrote a newspaper article and made a flyer about black mens health, I created a compilation of stats on maternal mortality for the CEO, and I worked on the Do Right! Kids and Do Right! Block by Block campaign. I went to Bush rec center every Monday for an hour to hang out with the kids and teach them about nutrition, and occasionally I was invited to help coordinate with the Walnut Hills Block by Block campaign. I enjoyed chatting with other employees and interns at the office as well. Everyone at my site was so nice and I am very thankful for their kindness and friendship.</p>
