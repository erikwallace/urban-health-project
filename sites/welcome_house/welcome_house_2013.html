    <p>I had the unique opportunity as an Urban Health Project intern this summer to work at two wonderful sites with very different projects yet ultimately similar goals - to provide resources to the underserved and improve the lives of those in the nearby community. I split my time equally working with the Breast and Cervical Cancer Project (BCCP) and Welcome House of Northern Kentucky.</p>
    <p>BCCP was formed with the fundamental focus of providing free pap smears and mammograms to eligible women in Ohio who live off of a limited income and no health insurance. In my work with BCCP, I had two major responsibilities. The first was assisting the program in outreach to appropriate businesses and non-profit organizations in the greater Cincinnati area. To ensure the surrounding community remains aware of the program and its resources, I spread the word by contacting 65 organizations throughout Hamilton, Warren, Clinton, Clermont, and Butler counties who are in close contact with women who may be eligible. To those that expressed interest, I sent pamphlets and flyers about BCCP to have available to clients. My second task was to conduct educational seminars at interested locations on breast and cervical cancer. This presentation included general health information as well as statistics, risk factors, how to do self-breast exams, and the importance of early detection. I also had the opportunity to shadow at the Barrett Cancer Center and the Dysplasia Clinic to witness breast and cervical biopsies firsthand.</p>
    <p>Welcome House of Northern Kentucky is a temporary emergency shelter for women and children located in Covington, Kentucky. It collaborates with the local community with the mission of eradicating homelessness, fostering stability amongst its residents, and promoting an overall just society. In my work with Welcome House, my main task was to lead weekly educational sessions on health-related issues. Discussions included stress, relaxation techniques, mental health disorders, kids and stranger danger, low-impact exercise, and healthy eating. My other task was to be available as an alternative resource for the women. I welcomed any questions they had. The rest of my time was spent helping out in any way I was needed.</p>
    <p>My work this summer was challenging yet rewarding. It is an experience I will carry closely with me as I continue on toward my career as a physician. With BCCP, I felt extremely useful working as their marketer and educational facilitator, as recent cuts in funding from the CDC has restricted their ability to pay for these facets of the program. I also spoke with a many women who seemed truly impacted by my presentation and determined to begin working with her physician to maintain regular breast and cervical screenings. With Welcome House, I developed close and meaningful relationships with many of the women and children at the shelter. When I first started, I was worried my conversations with the residents would be awkward. I quickly learned, however, that more often than not they simply appreciate having someone who will sit down and listen to what they have to say without casting hasty judgments. Undoubtedly, I will use this lesson in my future career, remembering to listen closely not only to my patient's heart and lungs, but also to his or her words. My increased awareness of available resources to the underserved community will also allow me to be a more prepared and knowledgeable advocate for my patients.</p>
