    <p>Working at the Welcome House allows an intern to interact personally with residents and help educate them about their own health. Since there are both women and children living in the Welcome House, it helps for the intern to not only have an interest in adult (women's) health issues, but also have a love for children, since you can have significant interaction in both an educational and play setting with the kids. The Welcome House has several branches: the Shelter, Social Security Outreach, Case Management, and the Gardens. As a UHP intern, I spent most of my time working with individuals from Shelter and presenting weekly education sessions to both the women and the children. My summer project was a Mental Health Preparedness kit for the women at shelter, as well as more kits for future use. This will allow my impact to be felt after my internship is complete. My interactions with the residents gave me a sense of purpose and accomplishment, so that I am assured now that my summer was spent well, and I leave the world more positive than it began.</p>
