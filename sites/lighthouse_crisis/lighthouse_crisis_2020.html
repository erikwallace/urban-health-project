  <p>While I know my project is a beneficial addition to the program at Mecum House, it is not my first talking point when I am asked about my summer. The youth I met were the highlight of this experience. I had the privilege of getting to know many teens on a personal level which led to meaningful discussions, trusting advice, and personal reflections. I learned about their struggles, courage, and resiliency. Through our conversations I realized that each teen was at Mecum House due to very different circumstances. Some are dropped off by their guardians, some run away from an unsafe home, and others are there because they had nowhere else to go after leaving the juvenile detention center. I also realized that even though their backgrounds were different, many of the teens formed strong friendships with each other during their short stays. This experience highlighted for me the importance of withholding uninformed judgements and assumptions. It also brought to my attention the beautiful friendships that can be born out of less than ideal circumstances.</p>
