  <p>Mental illness can cause people to behave in strange and unpredictable ways, but I realized that even if we don&apos;t acknowledge it, everyone wants to feel loved and acknowledged. And, a well-worn expression of pain for many of the residents is pushing others away, including the Urban Health Project intern. The feeling of being pushed away was fleeting, as by the end of the summer I had built extremely close relationships with many of the residents, and I really do miss many of them, especially as the monotony and impersonality of school has started again. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to be an UHP intern, and I have no doubt that it will not only serve me in the future, but also do a great service to my future patients.</p>
