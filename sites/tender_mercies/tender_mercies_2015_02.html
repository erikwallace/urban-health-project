  <p>I began my time at Tender Mercies with little idea of what to expect. Smoking and diabetes were two issues amongst residents that needed addressing. Over the summer, I attempted to tackle smoking cessation with classes, activities, and advocacy through education and support. Researching the topics and having these discussions has certainly helped me in feeling comfortable talking to people about their smoking habits in a productive way. There were numerous sessions this past summer where I felt a great connection with the residents about their habits. Having them feel comfortable enough to come and talk with me about their histories and goals not only with smoking, but in life, was the most rewarding aspect of the summer. This was true for most of my activities this summer while at Tender Mercies.</p>
  <p>Martha and I, in addition to our classes, held a clinic every day to check blood pressure, blood glucose, and answer questions about the residents' health. While it was nice to practice these clinical skills outside of the Simulation Center at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, the most rewarding aspect of this clinic was the relationships that were formed between me and the residents. It reaffirmed that medicine was the field I want to continue to pursue. Hearing the stories of the residents, where they've come from and where they want to go, was incredibly fulfilling. I learned many things this summer, but understanding and considering a person's background was one that will stick with me through my career.</p>
  <p>The clinic also showed me the power of longitudinal care and how gratifying working with somebody on their health can be. One woman, in particular, came fairly early in the summer to our clinic. We checked her blood sugar and found that it was through the roof. Over the course of the summer, we continued to monitor her. Each time we would offer counsel on how she can manage her sugar through diet and exercise while she was waiting on her doctor's appointment. Gradually, her sugar began to drop. I found myself rooting for her and was extremely proud to see it steadily decrease before she saw her doctor. It was so satisfying to see her progress and how effective medicine can be when both parties are involved.</p>
  <p>Tender Mercies has affirmed my path into medicine through all of the interactions with the residents. They taught me the importance of sitting back and listening to a person's story; it's amazing the amount they're willing to tell without probing. My final day with Tender Mercies was a culmination to my time there representative of the entire summer. The residents took their time to come out to a going away party to thank us for what we provided for them and we also got to thank them for everything that they had given us. They had given more to me than I think they realized and I had to thank all of them for teaching me lessons I will use to become the best physician I can.</p>
