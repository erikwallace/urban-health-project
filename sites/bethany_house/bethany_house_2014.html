  <p>Bethany House is a homeless shelter for women and children that has staff on hand 24/7 to meet the needs of the women, chaperone the house and ensure safety. During the summer, my day-to-day job was to support the staff. This including putting together intake packets, dispensing meds, checking chores and that rooms were kept clean, dispensing bus fare, manning phones, child-care, helping with dinner, etc so that things in the house run smoothly. The hours are very flexible. I also ran shifts on my own so that staff could take their vacation time. Finally, I helped with a few special projects over the summer. These included chaperoning children on a field trip to King's Island, preparing for the Summer Carnival, directing groups of volunteers, quality improvement and of course my UHP project on hand-washing with the kids of the house.</p>
