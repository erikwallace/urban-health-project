  <p>Throughout my summer I worked very closely with our clients and was able to form incredible bonds with many of them. I was also connected with many community resources that I had previously never known about and came to better understand the struggles clients face in trying to access these resources. This information on resources and the challenges and concerns of this population are things that I intend to take with me in the future. I now feel more comfortable recognizing warning signs that someone might need resources beyond what I as a physician would be able to provide them and can direct them in the proper locations of how to access these resources. Likewise, I also gained a better understanding of seeing the patient holistically. I understand now just how powerful it can be to simply listen to a patient's story and I now have a better understanding of how to advocate for them in the future. This experience reaffirmed my passion for working with marginalized populations and my passion for change in public health policy.</p>
