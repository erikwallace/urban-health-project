  <p>Addiction disorders and their management are covered only briefly in the medical curriculum&mdash;disproportionately so, given their high prevalence in the general population. My internship at the Center for Addiction Treatment was a valuable opportunity to learn more about addiction disorders from both social and clinical perspectives. The internship itself consisted of siting in on counseling and medical management sessions, attending staff meetings, and independent research. Our research project was to compile a best practices guideline on how to integrate primary care into an addiction treatment facility.</p>
