  <p>Working with UC OB-GYN has been a rewarding, eye opening experience. Throughout the summer, I have had the opportunity to shadow physicians, nurse practitioners, and other providers at many different clinics. During this time, I have both observed and practiced various OB-GYN clinical skills, such as measuring fundal height and listening to fetal heart rate. Additionally, I have learned how to discuss sexual behaviors with patients in a culturally sensitive manner and educate them on topics including birth control, safe sleep positioning for infants, and breast-feeding. Each healthcare provider has shared with me different diagnostic and procedural techniques as well as those for interacting with patients. This strong and diverse educational component of my internship has been complimented by the unique opportunity to serve a community of underrepresented, low-income, culturally diverse women. The practice of medicine and many common protocols are altered on a case-by-care basis to meet each woman's financial, social, and emotional needs. I have many times watched a healthcare provider look under a microscope to diagnose an infection, such as bacterial vaginosis, which would otherwise cost patients hundreds of dollars with a protocol lab test. Barriers that our patients face are numerous and often interfere with their care if not addressed. Some of these barriers include, but are not limited to, transportation, level of education, drug addiction, additional health conditions, and abuse. As a result, providers at our clinics work hard to not only address the medical concerns of our patients, but to also work with them, or reference someone who could work with them, on breaking down barriers that may interfere with their care.</p>
  <p>Aside from working with UC OB-GYN, I have spent time with a collaborative organization called Cradle Cincinnati. This group works to reduce infant morbidity and mortality in Hamilton County by focusing on pregnancy spacing (time between the birth of a live infant and the start of the next pregnancy), smoking, and safe sleep. My project has concentrated on creating patient-appropriate materials about pregnancy spacing. Throughout the creation process, I have surveyed and educated patients and faculty with flyer as well as edited, simplified, added changes, and translated the flyer as I received more patient and provider feedback. Our patients have truly opened my eyes to the importance of education. Resources to prevent unplanned or improperly spaced pregnancies are available to underserved women in Hamilton County through the Reproductive Health and Wellness Program. However, many of our patients did not previously have sufficient knowledge on how to use and access these resources, why they are important, and the consequences of unplanned or improperly spaced pregnancies. My internship has allowed me to connect with and gain a deeper understanding for the unique patient population that we serve. I recommend this internship to anyone who is passionate about working with underrepresented women, as it has been an extremely fulfilling experience and will definitely enhance my ability to be a caring, culturally sensitive physician in the future.</p>
