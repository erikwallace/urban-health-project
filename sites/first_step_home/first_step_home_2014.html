  <p>When I first heard about Urban Health Project, I knew I wanted to participate in this internship and contribute to my community. Through this internship, I had a very meaningful summer and learned more than I could have ever hoped.</p>
  <p>The site I worked at was First Step Home, a residential and outpatient treatment center that treats women, both pregnant and not pregnant, with drug and alcohol addictions as well as co-occurring mental health and trauma related issues. Their mission statement is to help women break the cycle of addictions and abuse so that they can become self-sufficient and provide a safe, nurturing environment for their children. The wonderful part about First Step Home is that the women can bring their children up to 12 years old on site while they undergo treatment. First Step Home is truly a home for the clients, and, for some, the first place that they have truly felt safe. The treatment offered at this site is very holistic and prepares women for living a sober and independent life. A variety of services are offered at First Step Home, including group and individual counseling, nutritional counseling, vocational counseling, and much more.</p>
  <p>During my first few days at First Step Home, I was overwhelmed by the busy atmosphere of the facility. Women and children were constantly bustling around as they moved from group sessions. Over time, I found myself learning how the site operated and how group therapy sessions worked. As I talked with my site supervisor, I learned that tobacco use is a concerning issue. Almost all the clients, including those who are pregnant or are in the maternal track, are smokers. As a result, I primarily focused on assembling a smoking cessation curriculum that was relevant to the clients. Before I could do that, I held a couple focus groups to assess the clients' knowledge on tobacco use, dangers of tobacco, secondhand smoke, and their readiness to quit. I was able to put together a curriculum that was education based, giving the clients the tools to make their own decision regarding quitting. The curriculum is well rounded and even addresses topics such as stress management, coping skills, and healthy eating. In regards to healthy eating, I also held a cooking workshop in which clients cooked a healthy but affordable meal. I am happy to say that through this curriculum, almost 20 clients are considering quitting smoking.</p>
  <p>The most enlightening part of my internship has been working with the clients of First Step Home. The hardships and obstacles that these women conquer every day goes beyond my imagination. Through medical school, I have learned the skills to be a physician. However, Urban Health Project has shown me a different side to medicine, the human side of medicine. Prior to my experiences at First Step Home, I had not had the opportunity to learn about addiction and recovery. By participating in this internship, I have learned how devastating drug addiction can be for this population of women. Through my experience with Urban Health Project, I have cultivated skills that I will use as a future physician.</p>
