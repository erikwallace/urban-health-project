  <p>This summer I worked closely with many women during their recovery process. I helped lead groups and came up with a project to get the clients more actively moving. Through my exercise program, we were able to show that exercise has a tremendous effect on improving mood, lowering cravings, and decreasing stress. It is my hope, that through this research, First Step will be able to implement a new exercise program to keep the client active and healthy.</p>
  <p>My main goal was to identify any needs that First Step Home had, and step up to fill them if I was able. I did research. I worked with clients. I led educational groups. I took clinical notes for other counselors. I worked with both the behavioral health and the Maternal Addictions clients. I received narcan training. I learned so much information about addiction and the recovery process. I talked with clients one on one. I gained an even deeper sense of empathy and compassion.</p>
  <p>This summer has been an amazing opportunity to see many different patient populations and to see the effects that addiction has on the mind, body, and spirit. It has opened my eyes to many histories and backgrounds. It has shown me many injustices that our future patients deal with and how important it is to have empathy and not judge others.</p>
  <p>This experience has been amazing and I have deeply enjoyed my time working with the women of First Step Home.</p>
