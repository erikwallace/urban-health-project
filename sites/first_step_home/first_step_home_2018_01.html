  <p>First Step Home provides women with a safe environment for substance use disorder recovery and long-term sobriety. During my time with First Step Home I was able to take a small glimpse into the complexity of addiction and recovery. One aspect of care at First Step Home that I particularly appreciate is that group therapy sessions are tailored specifically for women and emphasize the multifaceted nature of substance use disorder. The main project I completed during my internship was the development of curricula on the importance of exercise and nutrition during recovery, as well as current treatment for HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C. Over the course of the remaining six weeks, my co-intern and I held two workshops and one learning lab per week for the women in residential treatment. Additionally, we were able to hold two workshops a week for clients in intensive outpatient therapy. This allowed us to witness the clients’ recovery journeys as they navigated early sobriety.</p>
  
  <p>In addition to teaching classes, my co-intern and I worked in the medication room which gave us a basic understanding of Medication Assisted Treatment or MAT. We also created many informational flyers on common medical myths, safety of certain over the counter drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding, immunization schedules and more. We also are advocating for the addition of an exercise room that the clients can access due to the critical role exercise plays in recovery. Additionally, we worked closely with therapists, nurses, and nurse practitioners to learn about the importance of mental, physical and emotional health during recovery.</p>
  
  <p>Interning at First Step Home has given me a unique perspective on the opioid crisis, which is extremely relevant to my career as a physician. Through my many interactions with clients, I have been able to put into practice listening to and interacting with women with a substance use disorder in a non-judgmental way. As a result, I have been able to get to know them as people without any of the labels that society tends to put on them. It has been incredibly humbling to get to know the women at First Step Home and I will never forget the stories they have shared with me. The relationships I formed with the clients were by far my favorite part of this internship.</p>
  
  <p>Overall, I absolutely loved my experience with First Step Home. While it has taught me a great deal and there are many things that I will take away from this experience, it has taught me to never assume anything about a person’s past and how they ended up where they are today.</p>
