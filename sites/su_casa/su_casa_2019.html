  <p>When deciding what I wanted to do during summer between my M1 and M2 years, I knew that I wanted to be involved in something that would serve a purpose in my future career as a physician. When I envision myself as a physician, I aspire to be someone that is very involved in the community in which I practice. The Urban Health Project provided me with the perfect opportunity to participate in community service and make connections in the greater Cincinnati community. Working at Su Casa Hispanic Center, I was able to learn so much about the Hispanic/Latinx community and see first-hand some of the barriers that this community faces such as poverty, inequitable healthcare, and language barriers. I was able to appreciate the need for health education among this community, especially in areas such as the importance of mental health. I learned about the various services that Su Casa offers to the Hispanic/Latinx community of Southwestern Ohio. I also learned about the various services offered at the other community partners that also had UHP interns. This knowledge will be especially beneficial in the future in interacting with patients and knowing where to send a patient in the community for a specific need. My work with UHP this summer confirmed to me an idea that I began to realize throughout my M1 year. The idea that being a physician is so much more than having basic medical knowledge. Being a physician is about being able to treat the whole person, not just the medical illness. One must be able to consider the social determinants of health in order to identify other factors that may be impacting a patient&apos;s health such as their home environment, access to education, etc. This is a skill that requires compassion, empathy and an understanding for your patient&apos;s background. I believe that the Urban Health Project serves this purpose to help further develop these skills among young student doctors. This summer gave me invaluable insight into the Hispanic/Latinx community and allowed me to practice my Spanish-speaking, both of which are skills I will carry into my future career to make myself a better physician that is well-equipped to care for every patient I encounter.</p>
