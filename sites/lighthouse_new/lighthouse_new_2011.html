  <p>New Beginnings was founded in 1987 as a part of Lighthouse Youth Services, a multiservice agency providing social services to children, youth and families in southeastern Ohio. Initially, New Beginnings provided temporary housing, advocacy, individual therapy, and family intervention to girls between the ages of eleven and eighteen; however, in 1998 it became a longer term residential service for abused and neglected adolescent girls. Despite the transition to longer-term care, the site continues to provide individual and group therapy, as well as round the clock care for clients living in the home.</p>
  <p>This summer I was presented with both individuals and situations I have never really even been exposed to, none the less immersed in, before. The girls shared several unfortunate characteristics. They have all experienced abuse in their pastâ€”whether physical, sexual or emotional. Each girl, however, is unique in how this abuse manifests itself in her present life.</p>
  <p>My primary responsibility at Lighthouse New Beginnings was to lead the Summer Enrichment Program each day. The major purpose of this program, besides exposing the girls to the many highlights of the Cincinnati area, was to provide the girls' lives with some semblance of structure during the summer months. Everyday around noon, we would take the girls on an outing. Some favorites included the pool and the Teen Center in the downtown library, but we also went bowling, to the museum center, to Krohn Conservatory, and paddle boating at Winton Woods. Two special events over the course of the summer included a trip to King's Island and The Beach.</p>
  <p>In addition to leading the Summer Enrichment Program, I was also responsible for transporting and advocating for clients at medical and dental appointments. Lastly, I led several group therapy sessions covering various topics including STDs, pregnancy prevention, hygiene, and healthy eating habits.</p>
  <p>My project this summer was not quite as involved or time-consuming as many of the other interns; however, my work was just as significant. After witnessing the group therapy sessions led by the on-site social workers and leading my own sessions, it was plain to see that the girls responded much more positively and were generally much more enthusiastic about groups which involved arts and crafts. Unfortunately, the funds necessary to purchase such materials were not always available. Consequently, I purchased various art supplies, including canvases, treasure boxes, paint, and glue, which could be used during group therapy sessions with the Urban Health Project grant I received.</p>
  <p>This summer is one I will certainly never forget. There were definitely hard times, times that I wished I had taken the easy way out and just spent the summer during research. But by the end of the summer, I was sad to have to leave. It took a while to gain the trust of many of the girls, but once I did, it was definitely worth the effort.</p>
