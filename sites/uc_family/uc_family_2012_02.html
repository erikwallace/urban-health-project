    <p>As an intern for the UC Department of Family Medicine, I had the opportunity to work for Dr. Joe Kiesler, interact with several talented Primary Care Physicians, and work alongside a fellow intern for the summer. I had scheduled clinic times when I got to shadow doctors and meet with patients in the Mobile Medical Van, McMicken Medical Clinic, and Riverdowns Racetrack Clinic. This was a fantastic opportunity that allowed me to serve several unique types of medically under-served populations in the Cincinnati area, and to develop and improve my clinical knowledge. My co-intern and I helped to update the Community and Homeless Resource Map so that individuals can locate various services in the community such as medical care, transitional housing, treatment facilities, etc. My co-intern and I also volunteered to teach a health class to Pre-K through 2nd graders at Su Casa's summer program. Working for Dr. Kiesler in the Department of Family Medicine was a fantastic experience and an opportunity I'm incredibly grateful to have had.</p>
