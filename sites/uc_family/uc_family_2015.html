    <p>I began my summer working on the Homeless and Community Resource Map, which is a mapped list of agencies throughout Cincinnati available to the underserved population. We also took steps to make an online version of the map. Three days each week were spent seeing patients on my own but under the supervision of an attending physician, similar to the experience of a third-year clerkship rotation. These days were spent at the McMicken Integrated Care Clinic, the Medical Mobile Van, and the River Downs Race Track Clinic. This really helped bring together my clinical skills and develop my own style of seeing patients. My other hours were largely spent on the Resource Map, Race Track Clinic, and Race Track Health Fair. The Race Track Clinic has four patient rooms, a mini-pharmacy/lab, and over 200 documented patients who live in the dorms next to the stables. This job required me to see patients, organize patient transportation, interpret Spanish, order labs, write and pick up prescriptions, and oversee the flow of the clinic. We also organized a health fair which included vision screenings, HIV and hepatitis C testing, alcoholism counseling, free Medicaid enrollments, blood sugar and cholesterol testing, blood pressure checks, and general health information. The fair had over 75 attendees this year with 45 patients making follow up appointments at a vision clinic and many more following up at the weekly Race Track Clinic.</p>
