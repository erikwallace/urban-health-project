  <p>My time spent at Bethesda North Ob/Gyn Center was thoroughly educative and no doubt instrumental in my career development. When I applied to the Urban Health Project, I indicated the Ob/Gyn Center as my top choice because despite having been always interested in this specialty, I had not had much exposure to it. Once I got to clinic, the physicians and other staff at the clinic were instrumental in providing resources on how the clinic functions on a day-to-day basis and guidelines from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) on patient management as well as other study resources to adequately prepare me for clinic.</p>
  <p>While I was relatively comfortable working with patients to obtain a medical history, there was a host of other skills I was still lacking when I started my internship. Within the first week however, with the help of the residents, I learned how to do fundal height measurement, listen for fetal heart tones with a handheld Doppler, and perform vaginal swabs and pap smears. I also became a lot more comfortable with performing patient interviews, ensuring that I posed questions that were specific and relevant to their health conditions and concerns. On occasion, I had the opportunity to be part of the inpatient team across the street from the outpatient clinic at the Bethesda North hospital. During this time I observed a D&amp;C, a Da Vinci hysterectomy, and an external cephalic version. Besides seeing only the medical aspects of the clinic, I also got to sit in on patient meetings with the financial counselor and a social worker. This allowed me to get a full grasp of the totality of care that patients receive even beyond the examination room with the physician.</p>
  <p>When not busy seeing patients or sitting in on meetings with them and other staff, I was working on my summer project that sought to identify women at risk for missing their postpartum care visit. The goal was to tailor perinatal patient education in the at-risk group of women in order to improve postpartum return rates. As part of this patient education goal, my project culminated in a poster indicating my findings as well as a postpartum care brochure that has been placed in the clinic for patient consumption.</p>
  <p>I came away from my summer experience feeling more confident in my ability to communicate effectively with patients and challenged to ensure that all patients I see over the course of my career are receiving the same standard of care irrespective of their background and/or socioeconomic status.</p>
