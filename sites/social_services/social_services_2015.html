  <p>By the time my internship had come to an end, I had fallen in love with Catholic Charities and the amazing work that they do for a wonderful group of refugees. One of the things I loved was how dynamic the site was and how each and every day was different from the last. One day I might be helping to teach a Health Orientation Class, one day I might be helping a client at a job interview, the next I might be helping to furnish a new home, or another day I might be taking a client to a medical appointment and helping them understand the U.S. healthcare system. I had so much fun learning about the daily life of a case manager and about social work. My favorite aspect of this internship was learning about the different cultures of the clients and hearing about their stories. It truly makes you appreciate everything in your life. You also learn a lot from the clients; they teach you resiliency and humility. As a student doctor, I hope I can have as much resiliency and humility as my clients have while I pursue my studies. It was truly an honor to meet the staff and clients I worked with this summer. I wouldn't change my experience for the world. I hope that as a physician, I can continue to serve this population of people in their needs.</p>
