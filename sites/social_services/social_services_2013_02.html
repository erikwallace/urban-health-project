  <p>&ldquo;The strongly perfumed &ldquo;lady pilot&rdquo; had spent the past ten minutes vigorously gesturing towards the seat belt where Ram had been sitting. He knew that she wanted him to fasten himself in but he had never attempted such a task. He wondered how the key on one side would fit into what looked like a metal trap on the other. As he watched the metal trap eat the key, Ram quickly remembered his primary concern. He had just walked onto what seemed like an oddly shaped metal container. Ram had heard of airplanes and seen a picture in his class, but the realization that this large metal container would be carrying his family through the sky put him on edge, to say the least. The urgency with which the &ldquo;lady pilot&rdquo; asked him to fasten his seat belt did nothing to ease this anxiety, her perfume further nauseating him. Ram helped to fasten his parents to their seats and explained that it was for their safety. Although he himself was not fully convinced of the assuaging words he spoke. How being fastened to their seats would protect them if the large metal building fell out of the sky was beyond him. Ram had experienced this sense of unease many times in the past day and was beginning to realize that his new life would be one filled with uncertainty.</p>
  <p>A representative from the International Organization of Migration had explained to Ram that his family was going to be taken to Cincinnati, Ohio in the United States of America. He knew nothing about this place but was told that some other refugees from his camp were now living in Cincinnati as well. Ram had lived in Nepal for his entire life. Nepal, to him, was a piece of land, approximately 40 acres in size, with rows of bamboo huts which served as his home, as his school, as his doctor&#8217;s office, and as his source of livelihood. This Nepal was the place that granted his family refuge from persecution in their home country of Bhutan, but it was also the place in which he had been isolated from any knowledge of the outside world. His family had been forced out of their home in Bhutan at a time characterized by the discrimination and ethnic cleansing of many Hindus and ethnic minorities in a majority Buddhist country. They had fled to the refugee camps in neighboring Nepal, where Ram was born and where he stayed until just a few days ago. As the airplane accelerated down the runway, the roar of the engines began to drown the cries of horror and wonder that had been piercing Ram&#8217;s thoughts. He looked out of his window and took one last look at his home, closed his eyes and prepared for his new life.</p>
  <p>My experience with the Refugee Resettlement Program of the Catholic Charities of Southwest Ohio has been nothing less than inspiring. I have had the good fortune to have worked alongside some very diligent and passionate individuals, as well as to have met and listened to the stories of refugees from around the world. Although the majority of CCSWO&#8217;s clients are from Bhutan, there is a mix of other refugees from countries such as Burundi, Rwanda, Eritrea, DRC and RC, Iraq, and Sudan. The moment each refugee gets off of their often horrifying plane ride to Cincinnati, they are greeted with the smiling face of one of the wonderful staff members of Catholic Charities. From food, housing and language to social security, employment and medical needs, the staff works to help these new Americans make the arduous adjustment to life in the United States. Each refugee has faced numerous hardships in the past and continues to struggle for survival. Catholic Charities plays a key role in making easing their struggles and has seen many success stories from the clients they have served in the past.</p>
  <p>As a future physician interested in working with underserved populations here and abroad, my role in taking refugees to their doctor&#8217;s appointments was an invaluable experience. What may seem to be the simple task of showing up to an appointment on time is extremely arduous when considering the numerous obstacles faced by these patients. Transportation, scheduling, and language and literacy conflicts are just a few of the obstacles to providing these new, and often ailing, clientele with medical support. This summer, I was put in the position of the underserved patients who I hope to serve in the future. I have come away with an appreciation for their efforts to be active in improving their own health as well as an awareness of the obstacles they face in accomplishing this goal.</p>
  <p>The end of my internship is bittersweet. I am excited to continue with my medical education and put my newfound skills to use, but I am reluctant to lose such a valuable connection with the refugees and staff members who have done so much to remind me of my own motivations. The strength of heart and motivation of those at Catholic Charities, staff and refugees alike, are something to strive for since, in the words of the Sufi poet Rumi, &ldquo;Only from the heart can you touch the sky...&rdquo;.</p>
