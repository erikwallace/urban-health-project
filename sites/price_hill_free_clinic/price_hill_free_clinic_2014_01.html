  <p>Working at the Good Samaritan Free Health Center (GSFHC) was definitely a life-changing experience. I have learned so much and gained invaluable interpersonal communication skills that will facilitate my development to become an outstanding physician. I worked in the clinic as an interpreter for patient appointments and also as a social worker for the Spanish speaking patients that are enrolled in the clinic. There was never a dull moment at the GSFHC; from the second I arrived until the end of the day, I was almost always interacting with a patient either in person during appointments or over the phone to ensure that the patients were following and understood their treatment plans. GSFHC is a very exciting place. Almost every day there was an interesting patient case to learn from, and being involved in and getting to witness the volunteer physicians develop treatment or diagnostic plans for the various medical cases has helped to develop my clinic reasoning skills. The staff and management of the clinic make the work atmosphere very inviting, relaxed, and fun. Above all, it was very rewarding to be able to help the clinic provide medical services to a population in Cincinnati in great need and without any other alternative to seek medical care. I felt very lucky to be a part of the team at the GSFHC and I plan on continuing volunteering there for the remainder of my time at UCCOM and beyond.</p>
