  <p>As I arrived at the Good Samaritan Free Health Center for my first day of work, I literally had no idea what my duties would be. I had received a brief overview from some of the individuals who run the health center but I was still somewhat unaware of what the job entailed. I am a fairly quiet person so naturally, and my first assignment was to sit with a patient and make phone calls regarding an incredibly expensive medical bill that she had incorrectly received. I knew the phone number that I had to call and that the patient should not have received a bill, but other than that, I was pretty much clueless. I spoke with a woman in the financial assistance office at the hospital who was not very helpful and stated that the patient would have to pay the bill, regardless of her healthcare status or lack thereof. I hung up the phone and attempted to call another person in the financial office but was unsuccessful. I was so embarrassed but explained the situation to the patient as best I could. Thankfully, our patient was incredibly pleasant and understanding. She had a big smile on her face and assured me that everything was fine. Here I was, a medical student volunteer who was supposed to be helping this patient with her expensive hospital bills, and yet she was the one telling me that we would figure it out together. Looking back on this event, I realize that this patient was highly reflective of the patients at the Good Samaritan Free Health Center.</p>
  <p>Throughout the summer, I quickly recognized that the patients are very compassionate and truly appreciate all of the help that we provide. I spoke with countless people who quickly opened up about their past and all of the hardships that they had endured; and yet, they were all so pleasant and grateful for the volunteers at the clinic. The patients and volunteers truly have unique relationships that one rarely sees at other healthcare facilities.</p>
  <p>I was fortunate enough to utilize some of my healthcare knowledge with these patients while also developing my own relationships with patients. I was able to joke around and laugh with both the volunteers and patients whom I had worked with continuously. I had an awesome summer experience because I had a great blend of medical and social work. I was excited to go to work every morning in order to hear about patientsâ€™ progress as well as to converse with my coworkers. The Good Samaritan Free Health Center is truly an amazing place that does a lot of good for a lot of people and I am just happy that I was able to be a part of it for a few months.</p>
