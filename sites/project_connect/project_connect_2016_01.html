  <p>My summer experience was excellent in that it was both educational and fun. I got to interact with a  population in my city with whom I had never previously interacted. I got to know a number of young kids on a personal level, serving as someone they could come to for help or just to talk. I got to interact with and learn from inner city public school teachers on how to interact with people and how to handle various situations. On top of all of that, this experience was one of the most fun that I have ever had. I love working with kids, and this summer did not disappoint. Whether it was helping them with academics or taking them on field trips around the city, there was never a dull moment.</p>
