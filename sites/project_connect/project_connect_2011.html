  <p>Project Connect is an 8-week summer camp for children aged 5 to 12 who are experiencing homelessness. These children face a number of obstacles in receiving an education, such as frequently changing schools, a lack of school supplies, and difficulty in accessing transportation. Project Connect aims to remove these obstacles and to keep kids connected to their education through their summer camp in addition to other support.</p>
  <p>I worked with the 10-12 year old kids as a tutor, chaperone, and informally as a role model. A typical day consisted of morning academics with a focus on math and reading, followed by an afternoon enrichment activity at places around Cincinnati, such as the art museum or the observatory.</p>
  <p>My favorite part of the internship was getting to know the kids, their stories, their daily life, and how they want to shape their future. Learning the details first-hand all while establishing friendships has taught me more than the statistics presented in academic papers ever could. Through my experience, the cause-and-effect relationships that lead to homelessness have been elucidated in a tangible way. Many people I've talked to since are unaware that there exists a segment of children in our society that is homeless. I now consider myself a lifetime advocate in spreading this knowledge.</p>
  <p>Another aspect of this program that an enjoyed, and is relevant to a medical student, is having the opportunity to use my effort to make a real contribution. As a student, it feels like I spend an inordinate amount of time with my nose stuffed into books and syllabi. This summer I was able to work daily for a valuable cause and see results over time. This made for a fantastic break and I now see myself as fit to go into the second academic year with my batteries fully recharged.</p>
