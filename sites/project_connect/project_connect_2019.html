    <p>Since 1996, Project Connect has served children in the Cincinnati Public Schools who are experiencing homelessness. During the school year, they provide for students&apos; needs such as uniforms and school supplies, arrange access to transportation and educational resources, and advocate for the children. Over the summer, Project Connect hosts a special 6-week academic and enrichment program for the students. As a UHP intern, I worked with the 5-7 year olds at this summer program.</p>
    <p>A typical day in the summer camp goes something like this: At 8:30 I arrive to start preparing for the day and setting up the classroom. By 9:00 the students have arrived on buses and we start &ldquo;Moving in the Morning,&rdquo; where we all perform a dance routine to get energized and motivated for the day (this year&apos;s tune - Old Town Road by Lil Nas X!) We serve breakfast and then head to the classroom, where the students work on a variety of activities including arts and crafts, math, and reading. Some days of the week, we have special morning guests, such as someone who teaches the students to sing a song they&apos;ll perform for their families at the end of the camp. Next, we serve lunch, have recess, and then depart for afternoon fun! We went on many fantastic field trips over the summer, including the neighborhood pool, a Reds game, Coney Island, rollerblading, the movies, and more. After we get back, we serve an afternoon snack and then the kids leave to go home at about 3:30.</p>
    <p>Every day is a whirlwind, but we also have a blast! Project Connect truly feels like &ldquo;being a kid again&rdquo; in so many ways. Of course, there is more to being an intern than just having fun - I did my best to serve as a leader and role model for the students, and help with all of the activities inside and outside the classroom. I also conducted a short health-related activity with each class, using Glo Germ gel to demonstrate how we can wash our hands properly.</p>
    <p>In closing, I consider myself extremely fortunate to have gotten to know these kids. Project Connect stands by the philosophy that these students deserve to have just as many fun and educational experiences as any other child might have at summer camp, and I 100% agree. These kids are just like any others in that they are adorable, loving, innocent, talented, and have hopes and dreams for their future that they deserve the chance to pursue. Anything we can do to remove the immense challenges and barriers they face is a worthwhile endeavor.</p>
