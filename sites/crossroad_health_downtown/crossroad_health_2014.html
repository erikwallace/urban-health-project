  <p>This summer I have been working on various tasks that the Crossroad Clinic is focusing on as part of its normal function, as well as how it is can better adapt to changing healthcare in Cincinnati and provide efficient services to their patients. This has involved learning a lot about patients, to review their medical histories, and largely, to understand how they end up in the emergency room, and if Crossroad may have better served them. This has enabled me to help them towards developing new policies regarding ER usage reduction, helping the greater healthcare system and hopefully the patients themselves.</p>
