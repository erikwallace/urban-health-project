  <p>Crossroad Health Center is located in Over-the-Rhine, one of Cincinnati's poorest neighborhoods. It was founded in 1992 by a group of physicians who wanted to offer suburban healthcare to a poor urban neighborhood. They proved their commitment to this task by deciding to live in the same neighborhood where they would work.</p>
  <p>The passion of those physicians quickly rubbed off on me and I couldn't keep from idolizing their commitment and their drive to treat those who are often forgotten. My jobs included taking patients back to rooms, taking vitals, doing vision and hearing tests, printing immunization records, running the patient assistance programs, answering phones, etc.</p>
  <p>I was also fortunate enough to be able to shadow a few of the physicians on a daily basis. I learned an incredible amount from each of them. I also learned a great deal from the staff. They all seemed to be working towards the same goal which they in turn used to fuel their collaborative purpose.</p>
  <p>Overall my experience has taught me many of the struggles those in poverty face in getting adequate health care. It has changed the way I think about the poor and what they must do to even the playing field. Every Cincinnatian should be grateful that Crossroad is there to even that playing field and improve the city they love.</p>
