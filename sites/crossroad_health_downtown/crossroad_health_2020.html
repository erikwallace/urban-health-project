  <p>This internship will greatly affect my future career as a physician. Working with populations who are underserved or overlooked in the medical field has opened my eyes to the barriers these populations face every day and the impact these barriers can have on their health. Take language barriers for example, patients who speak only Spanish at Crossroads are 1) extremely fortunate to be able to receive care, since very few clinics have physicians and/or staff who can speak Spanish and 2) even though they can receive healthcare they still lack access to other resources (such as social resources for food, housing, job, and transportation assistance) due to the limited amount of Spanish speaking staff, volunteers and Spanish resource materials.</p>
