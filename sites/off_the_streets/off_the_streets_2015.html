  <p>Off the Streets&reg; (OTS) is an organization under Cincinnati Union Bethel that helps to rehabilitate women from a life of prostitution and drug abuse. The women that enter the program are provided basic shelter, food, clothing, and are eventually connected to social service organizations throughout the Greater Cincinnati area. The goal of OTS is to give the women a safe space to recover, grow, and ultimately receive their own housing/job. OTS was started in 2006 and has helped over 700 women in the Greater Cincinnati area. OTS is unique in that it is a peer driven program, meaning the staff of OTS have also been through the same hardships as the clients they serve, giving them an empathy that is vital and exceptional to connecting and helping their clients.</p>
