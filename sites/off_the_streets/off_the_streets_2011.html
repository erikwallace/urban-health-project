  <p>I can still remember hearing about Urban Health Project for the first time. It was during Orientation Week. Dr. Kiesler shared with me information about UHP at the Organization Fair. I was thrilled to hear that medical students found it a priority to give back to those in need in their community. I couldn't believe I had the option to volunteer the entire summer AND get paid for it. I made the decision to pursue an internship with Urban Health Project at that very moment.</p>
  <p>As the summer approached and I was offered an internship with UHP, I began to get anxious and excited. Which site would I be matched with? Who would I spend my summer serving? I found out that I was matched with Off the Streets, a collaborative, peer-driven program that coordinates services for women of prostitution. The goal of Off the Streets is to help women move towards safety, recovery, empowerment, and community reintegration. As a woman who has never abused drugs or suffered from sexual/physical/emotional abuse, I didn't know how I was going to relate to and help these women. I didn't even know if they would accept me.</p>
  <p>All of my reservations were lost as soon as I met the women on my first day. Without knowing who I was, they warmly welcomed me with plenty of hugs and smiles. I quickly saw the beauty in each woman. Regardless of their skin color, size, or age, they each have the same open heart. It is almost shocking to see the strength and love they exhibit when handling complicated and disturbing situations. They don't let depression, regret, or guilt rule their lives, and I am amazed at their ability to stay positive. Rather than living in the past, they use their time here to find ways to improve themselves and make the best of their circumstances.</p>
  <p>Working with the women at Off the Streets has allowed me to see the doctor-patient relationship from a unique perspective. Many of the women in the program have complex medical issues that they often do not understand. One woman's story emphasized disparities in health care. On a Friday afternoon, this particular woman received a phone call from her dermatologist notifying her that her biopsy was positive. She assumed she had skin cancer. After walking into my office crying, we spent the rest of the weekend worrying and anxiously awaiting her doctor's appointment on Monday.</p>
  <p>At the appointment, we were shocked to discover that she did not have skin cancer. The biopsy was in fact positive, but it was not positive for a malignancy. It was only positive for inflammation. At this moment, I was both relieved and angry. I was joyful, yet frustrated. I cannot be sure who was at fault, but I recognize that this should never have happened. Regardless of whether it was due to a lack of patient understanding or a failure of the physician to communicate, a devastating mistake occurred. I have taken this experience as a lesson for my future career as a physician. It is not enough to simply convey the information in a way WE deem appropriate; we must always make sure we are communicating in a way that is effective for OUR PATIENTS.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, patients, regardless of their background, should always be treated with the same level of respect. These women may have taken a different life path, but each woman is wonderful in her own way and has a life worth living. I will never forget the emotional stress of this situation, and I know that this young woman's experience will always stay with me as a reminder of how to provide compassionate care for my future patients. I hope to be a positive example for my peers and even for residents and attending when I begin my rotations. By treating all patients with respect and giving them deserved attention and compassion, I hope that the physicians around me will learn how to better care for each and every patient.</p>
  <p>At Off the Streets, my eyes have been opened to heartbreaking circumstances, and more importantly, to perseverance and the power of a positive attitude. We each have something to learn from these women. I know that I will always think of them when I am feeling discouraged or depressed. They have taught me how to believe in myself and stay positive. They have taught me that my life is valuable and that I have something to offer the world. They have taught me to learn from failures while moving towards success. Seeing these women overcome addiction and prostitution and move towards greater things inspires me to continue working hard to achieve my dreams. If they can stay clean and sober, I can most certainly obtain a medical degree.</p>
  <p>I am looking forward to watching the women at Off the Streets make positive changes in their lives. I hope to study with the women who will be taking classes at UC. I want to visit the women in their new apartments. I hope to stay a part of their lives to be reminded of the many ways they have changed my life. When I saw a woman write MY name on her "grateful list" I felt so loved and encouraged. As grateful as they have been to have me dedicate my summer to them, I am infinitely more grateful to have gotten to know them and learn from them.</p>
  <p>Off the Streets is a valuable program for the underserved population in Cincinnati. I am blessed to have had the opportunity to get to know these women. They have become my friends and have given me so much joy. My memories of our times together will motivate me to earn my medical degree in hopes of serving other women like them.</p>
