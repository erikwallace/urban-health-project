    <p>During my Urban Health Project experience, I had the opportunity to work part time at two different sites &mdash; Cradle Cincinnati and the Welcome House of Northern Kentucky.</p>
    
    <p>Cradle Cincinnati is made up of a collaboration of partners throughout Hamilton County whose goal is to decrease infant mortality in our community. At this site, I worked within two of the subgroups of the organization &mdash; the Learning Collaborative and community outreach group. For the Learning Collaborative, my goal was to provide them with data and resources they could utilize in informing each of the prenatal care sites about the communities they serve. Using data for the Ohio Department of Health’s Vital statistics and the U.S. Census American Community Survey, I analyzed health and social determinants data that can be integrated into a one-page profile for each of the health care site’s ZIP Codes. It is my hope that the profiles developed in this project will set up a good foundation that can be modified throughout the upcoming years to allow for up-to-date access of this information for the Learning Collaborative sites. Within the community outreach subdivision, I helped research for and modify a mindfulness program that will be implemented in the upcoming months in various communities throughout Cincinnati.</p>
      
    <p>Reflecting on my summer working with Urban Health Project, I am so incredibly grateful for this opportunity. It is my goal to work intimately within my community throughout my career; however, I unfortunately feel like time constraints currently put a limit on how often I am able to do so. As such, I am so delighted that I was able to spend this summer working within these populations and apply what I learned in my future as a physician. It was a truly unique, humbling, and motivating experience, for which I am exceptionally thankful.</p>
