  <p>This summer, I worked with the Ohio Breast and Cervical Cancer Project (BCCP). This is a CDC-funded project that offers screening and diagnostic services free to eligible women. My role with the Breast and Cervical Cancer Project was multifaceted. I served as the main connection between BCCP and the community, making calls to sites and inquiring about their current needs. I sent out educational materials on BCCP and its eligibility requirements to increase community exposure to this program. Additionally, there is an education component to BCCP. To this end, I held many community educational sessions for women at different sites. These sites were diverse, ranging from senior centers to homeless shelters, and I presented comprehensive information on breast and cervical cancer.</p>
  <p>Additionally, I had the opportunity to observe physicians in the cervical dysplasia clinic. I learned a lot more about the staging criteria for cervical dysplasia, and the screening/treatment guidelines that correspond with these stages. This was especially important since the screening guidelines for cervical cancer have recently changed. I also participated in the Su Casa health fair and helped register women to receive a free screening mammogram from the mammogram van. I was able to practice my Spanish and connect with a different population of underserved women, namely the Latino population. All in all, BCCP provided an invaluable experience and opened my eyes to the diverse network of community health resources in the greater Cincinnati area.</p>
