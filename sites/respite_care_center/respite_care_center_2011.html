  <p>The Urban Health Project originally appealed to me because I wanted to learn about the social and healthcare services available to the underserved people of Cincinnati and to probe my interest in working with the less fortunate. When offered an internship at the Center for Respite Care, it seemed like the perfect mix of healthcare and social work; of applying what I learned in school and expanding my boundaries. While every day I saw and heard about things that we had covered in first year, the new experiences were what made the summer truly special. I saw a side of the city that is seldom examined and easily ignored. I learned so much about caring and compassion, helping and healing. I would be hard-pressed to think of a better way to have spent my summer than working at the Center for Respite Care.</p>
  <p>The CRC acts as a safety net for homeless individuals in the Cincinnati area. It was opened in 2003 with the intention of providing a safe place for indigent people to heal after hospitalizations. By allowing proper recovery time, repeat hospitalizations are reduced which reduces the burden on hospitals, taxpayers, and, most importantly, the patients. But simply allowing for healing wasn&#8217;t enough. Since opening, CRC has grown into a place where the homeless can get not only their health back, but also their life back. While at Respite, clients work with the social workers on staff to connect to existing social services in the area and obtain entitlements (food assistance, SSI, SSDI); documentation (birth certificate, ID); and housing. For clients that do not qualify for an existing housing program, Respite has its own housing program that pays clients&#8217; rent for one year with money from HUD.</p>
  <p>My duties seemed to number as many as the services Respite offers. At different times throughout the summer I assisted with client transportation, moving clients in and out of permanent housing, client education, client job placement, housing, tech support, grant writing, manual labor, grocery shopping, and prescription pick-up. All of these tasks were rewarding and educational in their own way. Driving clients to doctor&#8217;s appointments allowed me time to talk with the client and hear his or her story. I was able to see common conditions such as diabetes, HIV, hypertension, and get to know the person behind the illness. Writing grants allowed me to understand Respite&#8217;s impact on the community. Working with clients to find jobs gave me an understanding of the obstacles to living a normal life this population faces.</p>
  <p>Towards the end of the summer I spent a lot of time with a particular client, trying to find a job for him. He was willing to do any sort of work, and we applied to many jobs together, in addition to the applications he completed on his own. He is a high school graduate with some college experience and a recent degree from a computer training program. But 25 years ago he got a felony, and now he can&#8217;t find anyone who will hire him. Whenever possible I take him to apply to jobs in person. I can call him anytime of the day, let him know I found a job to apply to and I&#8217;m going to pick him up soon. He&#8217;ll say &ldquo;Sounds great, see you soon, I&#8217;ll be watching for you.&rdquo; Sometimes they tell him in person they don&#8217;t accept applications from ex-felons, other times they&#8217;ll accept the application and never call. But regardless of the outcome, he&#8217;ll be just as motivated and excited next time we go to apply somewhere. This sort of perseverance is not uncommon for Respite&#8217;s clients.</p>
  <p>By far, the most memorable part of the summer will be the people of Respite. This includes present and former clients, the staff, the volunteers&mdash;everyone who sets foot in the door seems to be injected with a tireless energy (that&#8217;s not to say that coffee isn&#8217;t frequently consumed; it is). From the first day of the summer, the dedication of the people here to their work was apparent. The doctor and nurses to providing excellent care; the social workers to helping clients get back on their feet; the administration to providing the support necessary to make these things happen; the clients to healing, improving their lives, and bringing other clients along with them. This truly is a special place. It was no surprise to me when I learned that Respite has a profound effect on reducing healthcare costs for the homeless and that CRC far exceeds the success rate of other respite care facilities around the country. With the quality of the people here and the work they are doing, no other outcome could be possible.</p>
  <p>From these people, I will take away a new understanding of what it means to care for a person and a patient. To try your hardest and do your best for someone even when you know your efforts might be fruitless or go unappreciated. To go the extra step to do something that will truly change a person&#8217;s life for the better. To have patience when working with a person who has smoked for thirty years and never held a steady job to quit smoking and get a job. These are lessons I could have learned no other way, and things that will stick with me long after I have left Respite.</p>
