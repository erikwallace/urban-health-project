        <p>&ldquo;his summer working for the Center for Closing The Health Gap I gained valuable insights into the community that I will use in my future career as a physician. The summer was a mix of virtual and in person experiences. Most of the virtual experiences included me doing data analysis on previous initiatives the Health Gap had performed. I also researched the literature regarding different topics such as delivering needs assessment and survey questions for minority communities. I also created Diabetes informational pamphlets that the Health Gap is utilizing in an initiative this fall. The in-person experiences included Friday Healthy Food events, survey recruitment, and participating in the Scholar House Health Fair.</p> <p>The Friday food event is an initiative the Health Gap participated in that helped promote healthy eating. Each Friday the Health Gap would set up a table at the Old Kroger in Walnut Hills and would provide information and healthy snacks to those who stopped by. Other organizations also had tables and the Healthy Mobile Market was the main feature where people in the community could purchase fresh fruits and vegetables. At this event I mainly offered the healthy snack of the week, whether that was rice cakes and peanut butter, or turkey wraps, and I spoke with the different community members that stopped by. I also would administer a survey to the participants in order to gain interest in other events and to see if the events the Health Gap was putting on were worthwhile in the eyes of the community. At these events I was able to have casual conversations with many people in the community, who shared personal stories on how eating healthy and promoting those in their families and friend circles to eat healthy has changed their lives. They also shared how difficult this can be, because of the food desert Walnut Hills is located in, and the lack of resources many members of the community have to fresh fruits and vegetables. These events made a huge impact on my summer because they gave me first-hand experience interacting with community members and getting to hear what is needed for them to live a healthier life.</p> <p>The Scholar House health Fair was also an impactful part of my summer, where I helped deliver a needs assessment to the women who lived within the scholar House and then I also analyzed the data in order to create a plan for initiatives the Health Gap can implement in the future to positively impact the residents. I learned how important gaining the trust of the residents is in administering a survey and asking sensitive questions, but when I did, how open the residents were in sharing what most would benefit them. Building this rapport is a skill I hope to use in my future career as a physician.</p> <p>Overall this summer gave me meaningful insight on how to impact those around me; by simply listening to the needs of others.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ndash; Colleen Hoynes</p>
