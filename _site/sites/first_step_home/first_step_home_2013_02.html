  <h1>First Step Home</h1>

  <h2>Corin Marshall, Summer 2013</h2>

  <p>I had many jobs this summer at First Step Home, a treatment center for women recovering from drug and/or alcohol addiction. I worked with fellow intern Karen Chao to implement a series of classes called Starting from Scratch: A Curriculum on Nutrition and Health for Women in Recovery. These classes were split into a didactic portion, which covered various aspects of nutrition, and a cooking class portion. The idea behind the classes was to teach the clients how to plan and cook healthy meals for themselves and their families once they leave First Step Home. We also taught a series of health classes on how your body is affected by sexually transmitted diseases, hepatitis, opiates, cocaine, cigarettes and marijuana.</p>
  <p>Another part of our job was to do research on opioid maintenance therapies such as Methadone, Suboxone and Subutex. We compiled data regarding the effects of these drugs on mother and child during pregnancy. We also interviewed all the pregnant women at First Step Home in order to collect data to improve the maternal addictions program. This part of my job was definitely very moving, because I was able to get a first-hand look at how difficult the women's lives have been and how much they've had to endure.</p>
  <p>The women I met this summer have changed my life. Their courage has inspired me and their strength has humbled me. I have not only grown as a person by working with these women, but I believe my future as a physician will benefit as well. My understanding of addicts and what they've been through will help me to know how to relate to them. I am so glad I spent my summer at First Step Home and I look forward to returning to help out whenever I can.</p>
