  <h1>University of Cincinnati Department of Family and Community Medicine</h1>

  <h2>Anthony DeMarco, Summer 2017</h2>

    <p>All too often, I have lost the sense of why I wanted to become a physician due likely to being bogged down by academia, CV builders, and the vast array of other duties I have undertaken as a student. UHP, as was touched on during our Committed to Community poster event, has helped serve as a reminder&mdash;a reminder of my passions, my need to be patient, and the power of community.</p>

    <p>UHP has caused my passion for helping others and serving the community to become rekindled. I say this, not expecting this passion to now remain kindled indefinitely. I know all too well that I have highs and lows of motivation and energy, and to rely on my energy level to continue with my work would be na&#239;ve. In these moments of motivation, I can reflect on where I have been, where I am now, and make plans for the future. I can try then to remember what I have learned in these experiences, form lasting memories, and try to establish avenues, such as experiences like UHP, to help serve as continuous reminders of why I wish to become a doctor.</p>

    <p>Moreover, this summer internship has served as a reminder to be more patient. Life is messy; working in communities of people can be especially so. I have always known this, but I have also seemed to have forgotten just how disorganized it can be when working within a community. This is exemplified by situations such as when making a phone call that should realistically take 2 minutes to find out a few pieces of information turns into a phone call that results in 2 transfers, 15 minutes spent, and not all information being acquired. Or it can be seen when working with a patient trying to receive funds where it takes five people to provide appropriate care to one individual due to a language barrier and other challenges such as simply not having the right form at the right time. It is examples like these that make me realize that trying to do good and change even some of the smallest things can be extremely complicated. Yet, this leaves room to practice patients and to seek improvement with my own character as I attempt to change my expectations and perspectives.</p>

    <p>And so, UHP&#8217;s final reminder is that despite all the messes, working in a community can also be incredibly powerful. Since I had the opportunity to speak to people from multiple different organizations that are passionate about their work in serving others, I can see more readily how much strength we do have to make real difference in people&#8217;s lives. Moreover, talking with patients and providers alike in trying to acquire appropriate care for another allows for building connections and friendships that give my own life more meaning. Most of all, there is something beautiful and magnificent to see all the people, the same people who often make things more complicated and can even frustrate you, come together for one cause and overcome huge hurdles that never seemed surmountable. I thank UHP then for this opportunity to enjoy my &#8220;last summer&#8221; in such a manner, and I hope that these reminders will last for the rest of my life.</p>
