  <h1>University of Cincinnati Department of Family and Community Medicine</h1>

  <h2>John Ernst, Summer 2019</h2>

    <p>I spent my summer on three projects. First, I updated, assembled, edited, and distributed a resource map which lays out location, contact information, and a description of over 100 different agencies around Cincinnati that provide services that may be useful to homeless and low income individuals. I then took this information and updated our app - Cincy Homeless Resource Map - so that all of this information was available digitally as well. Through this experience, I was privileged to contact so many amazing people and agencies around Cincinnati and learn what good work is being done in our city. It was inspiring and hopeful, and I am thankful for the work that each and every agency is doing.</p>
    <p>Second, I coordinated a health fair at the racetrack. Thanks to our meeting with the Chaplain to get ideas about what the people needed, we were able to provide multiple screening and educational services tailored to the racetrack&apos;s workers. We provided blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and vision screenings. We provided assistance and information on insurance enrollment, STIs, alcohol use, and skin protection. And we are now working to provide follow up with these individuals to help encourage them to reach their health goals they made at the health fair. It was a very positive experience to see so many volunteers come out to help people prioritize their health.</p>
    <p>Finally, every Thursday evening I would work with my site director and few other physicians at the Belterra Racetrack Clinic. Every night we would provide primary care, medications, and education to the underserved individuals working at the racetrack. This was all completely free of charge. This was the best part of my summer. My role was spent coordinating the clinic logistically, helping ensure that patient care flowed freely. When I had time, I was able to get to know and learn from both the incredible physicians and the patients around me. Many of our patients spoke Spanish, and I am so thankful for their patience with me as I stumbled through each basic encounter and phone call. And I am thankful for getting to know a few patients in particular, those who would just stop by to say hi, to check in. These relationships were the sweetest part of the summer.  I know we did our best to help everyone we say stay healthy, and I wish we could keep working, spend more time, and live life alongside these amazing folks.</p>
