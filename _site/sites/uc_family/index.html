        <h2 class="pg-Subheading">Site Description</h2>
        <p>The University of Cincinnati (UC) Department of Family and Community Medicine is heavily involved with fellow, resident, and medical student teaching at the UC College of Medicine.

In addition, the Department sponsors a broad array of community service programs, providing free health care to many underserved patients in the area, including the homeless, Hispanic immigrants, troubled and disadvantaged youth, and the elderly. Urban Health Project interns provide assistance at the Belterra Racetrack Clinic, update the Community and Homeless Resource Map, shadow primary care physicians with the Healthcare for the Homeless program, and participate in other projects as needed.</p>

        <h2 class="pg-Subheading">Intern Quote</h2>
        <p>&ldquo;Every monday evening I worked as a medical assistant at Belterra racetrack clinic. My duties included checking-in patients, coordinating financial assistance and transportation to referral appointments, filing paperwork, and practicing clinical skills with patients. I would describe my role as similar to a medical assistant. I also had duties throughout the week in making sure the clinic was running smoothly such as inputting patient encounters into the medical record system and picking up patient medications. I also planned and coordinated a health fair at the racetrack clinic at the end of my internship. My other main role was to update UC family medicine&apos;s homeless resource guide, map, and app. I made phone calls to area agencies on the app to ensure contact information and services offered were up to date. I inputted these changes into the three platforms and sent the updated guides to all the area agencies.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ndash; Andrew Chrystman</p>
