        <h2 class="pg-Subheading">Intern Quote</h2>
        <p>&ldquo;I was primarily involved in engaging with clinic staff, patients, and patient records in an attempt to provide the clinic with information about how to best address the most common health concerns of the patient population while also addressing the need for vaccinating the patients against COVID-19. I was fortunate to be placed in a clinic that had a high workflow that was managed well by a helpful and resourceful staff. I learned about the intricacies of Medicaid and how to ensure patients receive coverage so they may be treated no matter their circumstance. I was able to familiarize myself with patient health data and how to properly provide it in a confidential manner to help the clinic best address its most common health concerns. Additionally, I had the opportunity to participate in medical outreach alongside PATH to patients experiencing homelessness where I spoke with patients about their health concerns and provided them with COVID vaccines. In addition to learning more about how the clinic operates, I played an active role in assisting in various administrative capacities when there were short-staffed needs. Being able to wear many hats this summer allowed me the flexibility to assist the clinic in any way that was needed, while also learning more about how FQHC's operate to best serve underserved patients.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ndash; Max Aveis</p>
