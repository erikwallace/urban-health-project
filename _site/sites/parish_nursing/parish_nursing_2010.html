  <h1>TriHealth Parish Nurse Ministry</h1>

  <h2>Brent Wanger, Summer 2010</h2>

  <p>A good ways into the summer it came to light that none of the 2010 UHP intern applicants chose the Trihealth Parish Nursing program as their top choice, myself included. Many theories prevailed as to why this might be. I personally believe that medical students might find the word Parish and its implications puzzling, or perhaps they feel that it would be more beneficial to spend their summer with a physician. Whatever the notions that kept applicants from giving the Parish Nurses a chance, I have to say that some of them were probably my own.</p>
  <p>When one of the nurses called and asked me to spend the summer with them I was at first hesitant to accept. When I asked what it is the nurses did I was met with a long answer that was very broad and perhaps even more confusing than the title Parish Nurse. However, something the parish nurse said must have struck a chord with me as I, obviously, accepted the position.</p>
  <p>I knew after the first day why it was I could never wrap my head around the idea of a Parish Nurse. Their mission is essentially to go where no one else will go and do what no one else will do with people who have little to no money to offer in return. Trihealth funds the nursing program and all of the employees are paid a salary through the department, but the services are offered to residents of the community for free.</p>
  <p>Based out of one of many local Catholic Churches each nurse is responsible for offering services in the local zip code and any adjoining that might be deemed needy. The individuals who receive services from the nurses do not have to be members of the respective Parish or even religious. I spent most of my time in Over-the-Rhine and North Fairmont, but did travel throughout Clifton, Mount Auburn, The Fay Apartments, Millvale, Downtown, Winton Hills, and Walnut Hills. All of which have high rates of poverty. I accompanied the nurses to many homes, soup kitchens, clinics, and local aid agencies as they tried to work those who had fallen through the cracks back into the health care system. My time was spent helping individuals with their medications, blood pressures, diabetes, nutrition, and mental health issues. The mission of the program will often bring you into the role of a social worker as you try and find a medical home for people with little to no income. I realized the full extent of the barriers my clients faced in a culture of poverty. I even learned a little about Burundian cuisine and what it might be like to get an eviction notice in a foreign language. I could go on and on.</p>
  <p>My experience working with the nurses was eye opening and moving. Simultaneously, I was appalled by the conditions of Cincinnati&#8217;s poorest neighborhoods and given hope by the compassion and knowledge the nurses provided. My career goals shifted as I saw that you don&#8217;t have to leave the country to find the third world. Throughout my two months as an intern I realized the true meaning of the term putting your patient first, and what a challenge it can be to hold true to this mantra. I have also learned just how important it is to be a physician who holds his duty in the highest regard.</p>
