        <h2 class="pg-Subheading">Site Description</h2>
        <p>City Gospel Mission is an organization which works with men experiencing homelessness. While residents, the men are provided with financial counseling, job training, assistance in finding jobs, day program classes, shelter, and three meals a day. All the efforts of the mission are focused towards moving the men into positive housing, and each resident is assigned a case worker to help them work towards that goal. City Gospel Mission also works closely with their two addiction recovery programs, Having the Courage to Change and Exodus, in order to offer services to residents battling addiction. Other partners included Jobs Plus, a local employment agency, and the Lord's Gym, a nonprofit, low cost gym with programs offered to the residents.</p>

        <h2 class="pg-Subheading">Intern Quote</h2>
        <p>&ldquo;uring my internship, I spent the first week or so just hanging out at the front desk, speaking with the staff, learning how to answer the phones, getting to know some of the residents, sitting in on some of the Day Program classes, and generally getting familiar with the flow of the shelter. My favorite memory of the first two weeks was helping one of the residents, whom I had gotten to know, move into his new apartment in OTR.</p> <p>Starting in week three, and continuing until the end of the program, I worked on a small study to investigate the relationship between an individual’s level of spirituality and their success in finding stable housing outside of the shelter. I spent a lot of time interviewing the 25 residents that were willing to participate. Just speaking with the residents and hearing their stories was one of the highlights of my summer experience.</p> <p>During the latter end of the summer, when I wasn’t working on my study, I spent my time working the front desk, answering many interesting and unique phone calls, helping with donations, answering resident’s questions, and doing anything else that the staff needed. Also, I was fortunate to spend a day working on the Jobs Van. The Jobs Van is a program where a CGM staff drives around the city and offers panhandlers compensation for a half-day’s work picking up trash on the side of the streets. The participants are given $45, a free hot lunch, as well as connections with resources. I learned a lot working with thez participants that day.</p> <p>Overall, I had a very interesting and unique summer with City Gospel Mission. I learned a ton from the staff as well as the residents, and these lessons will stick with me for the rest of my career.&rdquo;ing to the needs of others.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ndash; Jeremy Schnieder</p>
