  <h1>Breast and Cervical Cancer Project</h1>

  <h2>Avante Roberts, Summer 2011</h2>

  <p>As an Intern, I learned about the guidelines of screening for breast cancer, cervical cancer and women's health. I contacted over 60 community resources informing them about the BCCP and provided them with them with informational brochures. I also compiled an updated list of our contacts within the community.</p>
  <p>It was my role as intern to educate the women in the community about breast and cervical health and the importance of early detection. This year I created a new questionnaire to be used during these educational programs. The questionnaire consists of a series of true/false questions designed to determine how much information women in the community already have regarding breast/cervical health, statistics, risk factors, signs, symptoms, detection, and treatment. After they completed the questionnaire I tried to dispel any myths or incorrect information they may have had with statistical facts. I also gave the women the opportunity to search for lumps in the breast models along with providing them with numerous flyers and brochures. I gave educational programs at many sites including First Step Home, Welcome House, Booth Residence, and Off The Streets.</p>
  <p>I was also given the opportunity to shadow physicians and nurses in different areas of women's health. I have shadowed at the Center for Women's Health and the Breast Imaging Center at the Barrett Cancer Center.</p>
  <p>I am very grateful to the Urban Health Project for providing me with this internship. I feel fortunate that I have been able to share my medical knowledge with an underserved population. I believe these women truly want to protect their health and I feel fortunate to educate them on breast and cervical cancer and the importance of early detection. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Project is an invaluable resource and I hope anyone in need of their services will feel free to contact them.</p>
