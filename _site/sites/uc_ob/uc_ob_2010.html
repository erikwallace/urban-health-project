  <h1>Division of Community Women's Health</h1>

  <h2>Meghan Brown, Summer 2010</h2>

  <p>My summer's internship with UC OB-Gyn was both surprising and fulfilling. My internship incorporated some shadowing, opportunities to practice clinical skills and even a chance to use some Spanish interpretation skills which I had previously been nervous to break out in a clinical setting. During the summer I spent most of my time working out of Elm Street Health Center in Over the Rhine, which is where I first heard about the topic of Infant Mortality from one of the nurses. After a little of my own research I learned that Infant Mortality Rates in Hamilton County are extremely high, especially for certain racial and ethnic groups, and it is these groups who comprise the majority of Elm Street's clientele. With the full support and encouragement of Dr. Kelly and the Elm Street staff I developed an educational module for patients who came into the OB-Gyn clinic. I explained Infant Mortality to them, what it was, what causes it and what the picture looks like here in Cincinnati. At first I wasn't expecting much of a response, especially since this &ldquo;quantification&rdquo; of a public health issue seemed like a problem that would only interest health care workers. I couldn't have been more wrong. Patients were not only interested in learning about Infant Mortality but were eager to spread their newly acquired knowledge and curious to know what they could do to help. Some of the women I spoke to shared their own tragic stories with me, about babies who never made it out of the NICU, or who were suffocated when an adult rolled over on them in bed. Providing this information to patients who truly, genuinely cared, despite often coming from a day-to-day life that is harder than I can imagine connected me not ony to them, but to the entire community that Elm Street serves. This summer's internship shattered a prejudice that I wasn't even aware that I had, that the only people who would care about public health issues are health care workers, or people who have the time and money to. It's an embarrassing realization to have made but one I already know will prove extremely valuable as I continue through medical school and one day shape my own career. We are hoping to continue raising awareness for Infant Mortality in Hamilton County throughout the academic year and I believe the hope is that it is something for which next year's UHP intern can take up the torch. Despite my continued connection to the project I know I will stay in touch with the Elm Street community and staff and go back to visit. They welcomed me with open arms and made me feel useful and needed which is sometimes hard to feel in a clinic when you've only finished your first year of medical school. This summer certainly reinforced my drive to someday incorporate the care of the underserved into my practice and helped to remind me that there may be prejudices lurking even in the best of intentions, which is something I will continue to keep at the forefront of my mind.</p>
