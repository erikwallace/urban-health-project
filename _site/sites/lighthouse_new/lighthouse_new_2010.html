  <h1>Lighthouse New Beginnings</h1>

  <h2>Tiffany Hseih, Summer 2010</h2>

  <p>Lighthouse New Beginnings is a therapeutic community-based residential program for teenage girls who are victims of sexual offense, who suffer from emotional or behavioral disorders or who have been unsuccessful in other out of home placements. Many of the teens have been removed from their homes and foster care or are runaways. In addition to sexual abuse, neglect and physical abuse is also very commonly seen, and many of the girls have been in and out of foster homes their entire lives. The residents of New Beginnings live in a 6-bedroom house in a nice neighborhood in Cincinnati.</p>
  <p>I worked with 10-11 teenage girls between the ages of 14 and 17 during my eight weeks this summer. Every morning when I arrived, the first thing I did was read the log to see what has happened since the last time I was there. This is important because a lot can change overnight, and I often left with the house in one mood, and came back to a completely different atmosphere. During the day I also helped keep the log updated. Then, I go upstairs to wake up the girls for their Summer Enrichment activities. The Summer Enrichment program was what I was mainly in charge of. This program helps expose the girls to things they normally might not get to experience. We've done many activities ranging from going to the library, pool, museums, and even to Kings Island. We've also had speakers talk to them about subjects such as teen violence and sex education. In addition to supervising the Summer Enrichment program, I also made sure that everyone had completed their chores and cleaned their rooms, and I was also in charge of dispensing medication to the girls and making sure they took them. I also cooked sometimes, and pretty much just helped out with whatever needed to be taken care of around the house. Most importantly though, I served as a role model, mentor, and a friend to the girls in the house.</p>
  <p>New Beginnings residents focus on developing age appropriate life skills as well as addressing issues regarding their emotional and behavioral well being. In addition to individual therapy sessions that the girls attend, group therapy sessions are held at New Beginnings with all the residents. I have been able to help out a few times, and once was able to help run a therapy session focusing on hopes and dreams, which was very rewarding.</p>
  <p>While my experience this summer is not exactly clinical, I believe that what I take away from this summer is extremely beneficial to my future as a physician. I was able to gain exposure to adolescent girls who have been victims of abuse as well as those with emotional and behavioral problems, and even more, I was able to appreciate the challenges that this population faces in health and in education. I was given the opportunity to look into the life of a teenage girl for the summer and understand a little more what a patient is experiencing in their home life. I was able to read through the girls' case files, so I knew a lot about their backgrounds and what the girls have experienced before they came to New Beginnings. It is absolutely amazing what some of the girls have been through. One thing I've definitely expanded upon this summer is patience and tolerance. It can often be frustrating working with teenage girls who don't want to listen to authority, and who often act out. But I can think back to what I know they've been through, and it is easier for me to understand why they act the way they do.</p>
  <p>This has definitely been a rewarding and worthwhile experience. Although it's been challenging at times, I've bonded with a lot of the girls, and I am so happy that some have grown to trust in me as a supportive figure and a friend.</p>
