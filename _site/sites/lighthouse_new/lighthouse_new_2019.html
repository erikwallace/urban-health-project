  <h1>Lighthouse New Beginnings</h1>

  <h2>Abby Dillaha, Summer 2019</h2>

  <p>This summer with Urban Health Project was one filled with learning, reflection, and growth. I worked with the staff at Lighthouse New Beginnings to provide an enriching summer experience for the residents and tried to be a positive presence in their lives. I accompanied the girls to the summer work program at Lighthouse Community School, where they learned responsibility and tangible job skills. We worked together on projects ranging from gardening to painting to building, and the girls even learned about fresh vegetables and nutrition. Waking up early to work outside in the summer is not usually a very desirable option for teenage girls, so it was my job to be a smiling face, motivating them to face the day with a positive energy whenever possible and inspiring them to feel proud of their accomplishments. In the afternoons, I sat in on group and individual therapy sessions, which was a wonderful learning experience. I am so thankful that the girls allowed me to participate in this part of their lives, and I was thrilled to see some of them really grow over the course of the summer. When we weren&apos;t at the work program or doing some sort of therapy, we would go to the park or the pool, do arts and crafts, or watch movies. I tried to make sure that even with all of their responsibilities, they still got to enjoy their summer like all kids should.</p>
  <p>I&apos;m coming out of this summer feeling much more confident in my understanding of trauma and the mental health challenges that accompany it. I learned how difficult it is to teach kids about accountability for their actions while understanding that when children experience trauma early in life, it physically changes their brains in ways that can&apos;t always be undone, and therefore they can&apos;t always be held responsible for the ways in which they express their frustrations. I learned to have patience and to appreciate that it takes a lot of work for kids to learn how to modify problematic behaviors and cope with terrible things that have happened to them. I also came to have a greater understanding of how challenging it is to navigate the social services system and how we as a society can always be doing more to protect the most vulnerable among us. I believe the knowledge I&apos;ve gained over the course of this summer will serve me well as I continue along the path to becoming a physician. Working with these young women, I had experiences that truly changed me and that I&apos;ll never forget, and I formed friendships that I hope to maintain long after I&apos;ve left my job as an intern.</p>
