  <h1>Bethany House Services</h1>

  <h2>Jorden Arnett, Summer 2010</h2>

  <p>I was the 2010 Urban Health Project summer intern at Bethany House Services. I wanted to work at the shelter to gain knowledge about other aspects of serving those in need in the community. I wanted to benefit the organization and make a positive impact but instead I was given so much from Bethany House and the women who work and live there. I doubt they will ever fully understand what all I learned from them or what a positive impact they openness and wisdome has had on me. It was an amazing summer and I would chose exactly that same site if I had to do my summer over again.</p>

  <p>This summer has taught me so much. It is difficult to know where to begin. The staff and residents have taught me much more than I ever anticipated. One thing that struck me right away is how strong and resilient some of the women at the shelter have been throughout their lives and continue to be now. Before I began at the shelter, I went through a shocking divorce. The first time I met with Ms. Darlene, I thought, "How is it that I was placed in the location?" It seemed like someone knew I needed to be with women who were fighters and survivors and sent Bethany House to me, rather than me to Bethany House. From the guests I had the honor of getting to know, I also learned lessons I will always carry with me. In the face of chaos and frustration, some of the women I saw continued to love their children, teach them manners, keep a smile on their face, and get up every day expecting it to be better than the last. For someone like me, seeing how positive and hopeful some of women and their children remained really changed how I will deal with unforeseen situations for the rest of my life.</p>

  <p>It has truly, truly been a privilege to spend this summer with everyonne at Bethany House. I hope I gave them a fraction of the benefit they gave me. The purpose of this summer and the Urban Health Project is to help educate future doctors about how to better serve their patients, especially those who have a hard time accessing health care. One of the greatest lessons I learned from the Bethany staff is how to keep positive regardless of the outcome and how to start each and every day giving all you have hoping for the best. Being in this type of work can drain you and burn you out but I watched the case managers, social services workers, and Ms. Darlene keep positive and keep trying to serve the best they can in the face of frustration and negativity. From the guests, I learned quickly that many people do not chose homelessness. One of the greatest things I realized is that we cannot judge people by what happens to them but by how they deal with and recover from what happens to them in their life.</p>
