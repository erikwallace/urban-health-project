  <h1>Tender Mercies, Inc.</h1>

  <h2>Omar Saqr, Summer 2017</h2>

  <p>When I began my time at Tender Mercies I was incredibly frustrated. On my first day at my site a one of the residents had passed away. While the underlying cause of his death cannot be confirmed to anyone but his family, his obesity and chronic uncontrolled diabetes were suspected to be involved. From day one I sought to understand how this death, as well as those in the preceding few months, could have happened. Tender Mercies residents enjoy free meals prepared by over 2,000 volunteers but often those meals are cheap and not health conscious. In addition to this challenge, resident self-reported that they did not exercise much or at all. Both these issues compounded their struggle with mental health.</p>

  <p>Despite my work, contribution, and great strides this summer, I struggled with a sense of hopelessness. How can we empower residents who have struggled much of their lives with mental health disorders to take action to improve their own current condition or will they be forever haunted by the unfavorable determinants of health that have shaped them? What could I do, as one individual, to bring about lasting change in such a short time? Was the internship simply a learning experience for me, devoid of tangible impact? What can we possibly do as students and, one day, physicians to bring about meaningful change for those whose care we are charged? These questions lingered in my mind for much of the summer. In response to them I sought to think long term, to address the underlying causes of stagnation and helplessness which was found not merely within the residents but the culture that surrounds them. I endeavored to establish long term pursuits that would equip the residents with the tools to empower them and ultimately aide them on their journey to freedom.</p>

  <p>I realized this summer that as human beings, forever bound to our bodies and thoughts, we cannot simply dream ourselves into good health, that we must hammer and forge ourselves into it. I learned too that it is the responsibility of each individual to undertake this lone journey despite whatever real and tragic circumstance that may have fashioned their victimhood and robbed people of their self-efficacy. I understood, that we can only aide people on this individual quest by crafting a culture of affirmation, encouragement, and hope. I grew to learn that despite our small means and limited time, our ideals, hopes, and the causes we cherish may not be realized in the short time allotted to us, but that we must always play our part here and now and fight, and fight again, and keep fighting to bring about change in the lives of those around us. I cannot make choices or take actions on behalf of my residents or my future patients that will bring about their improved health, but I can call them to it and give them the tools and means and show them the way. These were powerful lessons for me, lessons that I hope to carry with me in the years ahead of me.</p>
