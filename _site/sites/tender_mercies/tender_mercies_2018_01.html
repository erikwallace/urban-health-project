  <h1>Tender Mercies, Inc.</h1>

  <h2>Diana Sarfo, Summer 2018</h2>

  <p>When I was first assigned to Tender Mercies I was extremely hesitant to work with a population of homeless people who had mental health issues. They weren&apos;t a population I gave any thought of working with but in the most amazing way, life enlightened me on this path and taught me numerous lessons through the lives of the people I was blessed to interact with. And I would do it all over again! Tender Mercies provides permanent housing for over 100 people in group styled living. With 6 buildings located in OTR, every resident has their own room with shared common areas.  Tender Mercies works to provide food with over 5,000 volunteers in addition to recreational activities for the residents to build a community amid addressing their social or health concerns. And this is where Melissa and I came in.</p>
  
  <p>We worked with a few different staff at our site to help coordinate events that were already in place while being allowed the flexibility and opportunity to implement a few of our own ideas. We worked with the volunteer coordinator to stock up on supplies for the in-house store. We also made calls to bring in different organizations who showed interest in volunteeringâ€”for example a nail technician came for the ladies every other week.  We had a chance to implement mindfulness and stress reducing practices within the women&apos;s group. My tuesday mornings with these ladies were by far the highlight of my summer at Tender Mercies. We were able the journal, cook breakfast together, connect, address personal struggles and encourage each other with advice and praises. It was a safe place and a home for all of their fears to be released and their strengths to be celebrated. In addition to the bingo games, movie nights, bowling trips and other activities, we were able to shine a light on many of their health concerns. With our weekly mini- clinics we were able to help residents with high blood pressure stay on track with their medications, check glucose and answer any acute questions we could. By cooking lunches for the residents, we were also able to introduce cheap and healthy meal choices especially needed within this population where many residents were battling diabetes. We got to do so much this summer and hearing their stories was amazing! I realized that I had a lot of personal similarities with a few residents who also had a history in my home city Chicago. I was able to hear their random facts and absorb their opinions on improvements for physicians based on their experiences. My dignity and integrity was greatly improved and strengthened by the empathy I learned to have. Thank you UHP for the opportunity to become a more ground human for my future patients and colleagues.</p>
