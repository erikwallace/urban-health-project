        <h2 class="pg-Subheading">Intern Quote</h2>
        <p>&ldquo;Working with LifeCenter has truly been an eye-opening experience. I came in knowing little-to-nothing about organ, eye and tissue donation.Though I am a registered donor, it wasn&apos;t until I interned with LifeCenter, that I knew what it really meant to be a donor. This summer, I learned about the rampant misinformation being spread regarding organ donation, and the best ways in which to tackle it. Hearing from donor recipients, donor families, and all those touched by donation, I learned how powerful the gift of donation can be. Because there are so many myths surrounding donation, we tend not to focus on the benefits of being a registered donor, and the power you have to save someone&apos;s life. Working with Audrey Holtzman, the Community Outreach Educator at LifeCenter has provided me first-hand experience of what it means to know and live in the community you serve. So many of our outreach initiatives were possible because Mrs. Holtzman was so well-connected to the community. This is a quality that is so important to the work we do as healthcare providers, and helps build trust and bridge gaps between healthcare workers and community members. My experience with LifeCenter has shaped how I view my role in society and I am grateful I had the opportunity to spend my summer serving the community through Urban Health Project.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ndash; Veronica Takougang</p>
