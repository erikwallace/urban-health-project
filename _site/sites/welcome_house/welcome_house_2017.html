  <h1>Welcome House of Northern Kentucky</h1>

  <h2>Roxanne Rezaei, Summer 2017</h2>

    <p>I worked at two different sites for my Urban Health Project experience, Project Connect and Welcome House of Northern Kentucky.</p>

    <p>Project Connect is a summer camp for children experiencing homelessness in Cincinnati.  My tasks included preparing the classroom for the day&#8217;s activities, monitoring the children during recess and breakfast, and helping the teachers with the dayâ€™s lessons.  When not in the classroom, we took the children to different field trips such as Kings Island, Cincinnati Zoo, P&amp;G Science Fair, and more.  For our health based focus, the other UHP intern and I held hygiene based sessions for the children.  I had an amazing time with Project Connect, I mentored children, went on fun field trips, and help these children going through a hard time to remember what should be the most important thing to them &mdash; being a kid.</p>

    <p>Welcome House of Northern Kentucky is a shelter for women and children experiencing homelessness. While I was at Welcome House, I created health sessions for children and women based on the health questions and concerns I heard from the families.  I was able to take charge in creating different workshops and we&#8217;re able to work on my communication skills &mdash; specifically conveying medical formation to people with a non-medical background.</p>

    <p>Looking back, I am glad I spent my last summer working with Urban Health Project.  In addition to gaining experience creating health sessions and working with children, I was glad I was able to go back out into the community.  When I started medical school, I knew I wanted to have a community focus.  Unfortunately, there is not enough extra room in our curriculum to allow for heavy community outreach.  I am humbled by the families who opened up to me about their experiences and will remember their struggles as a proceed in my professional career.  Before the summer, I needed a reminder as to why I went into medicine, being a part of Urban Health Project has given me that important reminder.</p>
