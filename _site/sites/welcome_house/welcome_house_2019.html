  <h1>Welcome House of Northern Kentucky</h1>

  <h2>Meghan St. John, Summer 2019</h2>

    <p>This summer I worked part-time at the Welcome House of Northern Kentucky&apos;s emergency shelter for women and children. I served two primary roles: (1) healthcare and wellness educator, and (2) emotional resource. Mondays through Thursdays I held classes, activities, and workshops in the evenings. Any time before class was spent drafting curriculums or being a pair of ears for residents (and staff!) to talk about health concerns, vent about the stresses of homelessness and living in the shelter, or just &ldquo;shoot the breeze.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>During classes, I challenged myself to actively involve the residents. I quickly learned that empowerment was the best way to engage them. They loved to supply music, design worksheets, lead meditations, and suggest activities. It was awesome seeing them passionately pursue their interests without hesitation – including yoga and even bug-catching – and to watch them work together to solve problems. For example, during our SMART Goals session, Welcome House residents brainstormed with each other on ways to achieve their aims and keep accountable. While I gave them tips here and there, they drove their own progress.</p>
    <p>Because classes were in the evenings, I looked for ways to improve their health throughout the day, as well. Residents particularly liked our step competitions. We downloaded a free pedometer app that didn&apos;t require an account, and winners varied from most steps to most improved. They also really enjoyed our teaching kitchen – even the kids got excited about chopping vegetables!</p>
    <p>The most gratifying part of the summer was seeing the women gradually becoming engaged. They face stressors and challenges that I can&apos;t begin to fathom, so I&apos;m sure the last thing they want to do at the end of the day is attend some health class put on by a relatively well-off medical student. However, as the summer went on, I noticed that more people came to my events and that they took increasingly active roles during them. Upon reflection, it became clear to me that the people we serve, in addition to leading hectic lives, have reason to be hesitant. One resident put it best when she told me on my last day, &ldquo;When I first met you, I was skeptical. A medical student coming to show us how to do things? Asking us personal questions about ourselves? But as I got to know you, it became clear that you genuinely cared about us, and I looked forward to seeing your smile and positivity every day.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The residents at Welcome House gave me an incredible, unforgettable summer. They showed me kindness, made me laugh, taught me vulnerability, and inspired me with their authenticity. While it was heartbreaking to leave knowing that I was a source of stability for them, I can rest assured knowing that each person I met is resilient, passionate, and capable. My biggest hope is that during this internship I gave them the tools to realize these qualities within themselves.</p>
