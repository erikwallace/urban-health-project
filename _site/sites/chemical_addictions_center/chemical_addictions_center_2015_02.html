  <h1>Center for Addiction Treatment</h1>

  <h2>Ben McGlothlin, Summer 2015</h2>

  <p>My summer at the Center for Addiction Treatment (CAT) has really been my introduction and immersion into addiction medicine and the disease itself. There are 23 million Americans suffering from alcohol and drug addiction and Hamilton County is doing worse than the rest of the country on dealing with this disease. Although it is not a disease we always treat effectively, it is a rapidly developing field and it was exciting to play a small part in that through my experience with UHP. It has been incredible to see people at every stage, from detox to long-term recovery, as well as seeing the impact the disease also has on the loved ones of CAT&#8217;s patients. We often only are exposed to what people do to supply their addiction by the media, and CAT really allowed us to see a complete picture of the disease, its effects, and how we can impact addiction and patients suffering from addiction as physicians.</p>
  <p>As a CAT intern, my overall focus was to help the organization transition into and develop a more integrated patient care model. CAT currently only treats patients for their drug, alcohol, or gambling addiction. Over the next few years they will move into both behavioral health and primary care, to help improve outcomes for their patients. Some of my projects to help in this transition included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Completing policy review and application for Ohio Department of Mental Health &amp; Addiction Services (OHMAS) accreditation without deemed status in Behavioral Health Counseling &amp; Therapy and Mental Health Assessment</li>
    <li>Developing a Trauma Informed Care Action Plan for CAT</li>
    <li>Developing a implementing a Hepatitis B/C Screening Policy for CAT&#8217;s medication-assisted treatment (MAT) clinic</li>
    <li>Developing Content for CAT&#8217;s website redevelopment</li>
    <li>Developing a disposition model to more closely align with OHMAS</li>
    <li>Working with counseling and clinical staff in CAT&#8217;s MAT clinic</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My summer with UHP and CAT has been extremely rewarding and I know the lessons I have learned will go with me far beyond my years as a medical student. As CAT alum, it is my responsibility to help my classmates, society, and my future patients understand that addiction is just like any other disease. As UHP alum, I have a much better idea of what it means to practice the art of medicine and how much of an impact you can have on your patients beyond treating their physical ailments. My time with UHP will make me a better student, a better physician, and a better person and I could not have asked for a better experience.</p>
