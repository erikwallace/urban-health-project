  <h1>Center for Addiction Treatment</h1>

  <h2>Rob Thompson, Summer 2011</h2>

  <p>This summer's internship with UHP has been eye-opening. I had very little knowledge about the disease of addiction and substance abuse, but after completing my internship at the Center for Addiction Treatment I feel that I have a wealth of knowledge about addiction that I will be able to apply to my career as a physician. The most important thing I learned during my internship is that addiction is not a moral issue, but a disease, and it will be my responsibility as a physician to understand that, and to approach patients that are struggling with substance abuse with a mind set of medically treating them and providing them with the information and resources to deal with the mental and spiritual aspects of addiction.</p>
  <p>This summer I observed the treatment of addiction from the start, with admissions, to the end with, graduation from aftercare. In admissions, I was able to see the patients at their worst, and I was able to see the challenges the patients face trying to seek treatment. I then was able to sit in on small group therapy sessions and hear first hand the struggles the patients deal with in seeking a clean and sober life. I was able to learn about using behaviors, and warning signs of substance abuse; which I will be able to apply to my future practice as a physician. I was able to spend time in the medically monitored detox unit, where I was able to witness detoxification first hand and observe how sick the patients are and how painful withdrawal is. I had the opportunity to spend the majority of my time in the Suboxone clinic where I was able to shadow the physicians and see how each physician approaches medically treating opioid dependency. I was also able to do the intake interviews and urine screens of the patients before they saw the doctor; this allowed me to interact with the patients one-on-one, and learn from them by hearing their individual stories.</p>
  <p>My project was to compile a community resource guide specific to the patient population at CCAT. My project demonstrated to me the support available to those in need, but it also showed me the flaws of the system and how difficult and challenging life can be without insurance, food, and money. Completing my project allowed me to see how important it will be for me, as a physician, to know about the resources and services available to my patients. The project was very time consuming and required me to call every single site to gather information, but in the end it was very rewarding because the staff has been very excited about having the resource guide at their disposal, it was used immediately, and I was even able to provide patients with information on resources that they requested. With the positive feedback and joyous remarks about my project I felt that I have made a lasting impact at CCAT.</p>
