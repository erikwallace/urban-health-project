<h2 class="pg-Subheading"><a name="summer-intern"></a>Summer Intern Information</h2>

<p>Each Urban Health Project intern is a medical student who has completed the first year of coursework and is seeking an opportunity to give back to the community while gaining a greater appreciation for and understanding of the many factors that impact health. The intern will complete an eight-week internship at a site within the Greater Cincinnati or Northern Kentucky area during the summer between their first and second years of medical school.</p>

<p>Responsibilities of interns vary widely from site to site. Examples include leading group sessions for those who utilize site services, participating in the daily administrative duties involved in running an agency, and interacting with clients at meals, on outings, and during chores. Other sites request that interns accompany doctors, nurses, counselors, or social workers as they see patients and then allow the interns to use their experiences as medical students to develop projects that benefit clients.</p>

<h4>Responsibilities:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Work eight of the nine weeks during the summer</li>
  <li>Complete a project furthering the work of the assigned site</li>
  <li>Complete weekly reflections on insights and experiences</li>
  <li>Attend Urban Health Project-coordinated enrichment activities throughout the summer</li>
  <li>Create and present a poster about the internship experience at the Committed to Community Event at the end of the summer</li>
  <li>Maintain good academic standing with the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine</li>
</ul>

<h4>Benefits:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Interact with and assist underserved populations in Greater Cincinnati</li>
  <li>Gain a better understanding of the cultural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors that impact health</li>
  <li>Learn how service-focused community organizations function</li>
  <li>Receive a $3,750 stipend</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to apply:</h4>
<p>An interest meeting will be held in December or January for all first-year students interested in applying for a summer internship. Applications will be available in February. Interviews may be requested by some site supervisors throughout the month of March.</p>

</ul>

<h4>Benefits:</h4>

<h2 class="pg-Subheading"><a name="faq"></a>FAQ</h2>

<h4 class="ob-Question">How are interns matched with sites?</h4>
<div class="ob-Answer">
  <em>On the application, candidates indicate the characteristics they desire in their potential summer internships. Such characteristics include the balance between clinical and social service involvement; schedule and structure considerations; and populations the prospective interns would like to serve. Applicants are also invited to indicate if there are sites at which they would not be willing to work. The Co-Directors will send applications to appropriate sites for review. After reading the applications, sites rank the candidates whom they feel are the best fit for their organization. Some sites, though not all, conduct interviews during this process. Once all the rankings have been received, the Co-Directors place interns based on site and applicant preference as well as availability.</em></p>
</div>

<h4 class="ob-Question">What if an intern wishes to apply to other summer experiences in addition to Urban Health Project?</h4>
<div class="ob-Answer">
  <em>UHP welcomes anyone who may be interested in applying to Urban Health Project to do so while concurrently applying 
  to other opportunities.  However, once an applicant is placed in an internship and accepts the position, they are contractually 
  obligated to withdraw themselves from consideration elsewhere, and complete the internship they have accepted. Several sites offer part-time experiences, so there is a potential for combining an internship with an additional experience. Please contact the Co-Directors for more information</em></p>
</div>

<h4 class="ob-Question">How many vacation days are allowed for interns?</h4>
<div class="ob-Answer">
  <em>The summer after the first year of medical school is nine weeks long; of those nine weeks, interns are expected to work the equivalent of 40 eight-hour days (eight weeks). Depending on what is arranged with the site, interns may take days off throughout the summer or take an entire week off at once.</em></p>
</div>

<h4 class="ob-Question">Do interns have to work on weekends/evenings?</h4>
<div class="ob-Answer">
  <em>Many partner organizations are open 24/7 and, as such, may request that an intern&#8217;s schedule vary from the typical 9-5 workday. However, any regular time spent outside of this time window will be set before the beginning of the internship and will count towards the work requirements for interns. If you are limited to typical work hours, please indicate so on your application so that we can place you appropriately.</em></p>
</div>

<h4 class="ob-Question">If I don&#8217;t have a car, can I still be involved in an Urban Health Project internship?</h4>
<div class="ob-Answer">
  <em>Yes, many of our sites are accessible by public transportation. If you will not have access to a vehicle during the summer, please indicate so on your application. Interns are responsible for securing their own transportation to their sites.</em></p>
</div>

<h4 class="ob-Question">Will applying for a Co-Director position in addition to an internship make me more likely to receive an internship?</h4>
<div class="ob-Answer">
  <em>No, it will not. The responsibilities and commitments of a Co-Director are very different from those of an intern. Urban Health Project understands that people&#8217;s interests and talents fall in different areas and, therefore, applicants will not be given an advantage, nor will they be penalized, based on whether or not they choose to apply for the position of Co-Director.</em></p>
