<h2 class="pg-Subheading"><a name="summer-intern"></a>Summer Intern Information</h2>

<p>Each Urban Health Project intern is a medical student who has completed the first year of coursework and is seeking an opportunity to give back to the community while gaining a greater appreciation for and understanding of the many factors that impact health. The intern will complete an eight-week internship at a site within the Greater Cincinnati or Northern Kentucky area during the summer between their first and second years of medical school.</p>

<p>Responsibilities of interns vary widely from site to site. Examples include leading group sessions for those who utilize site services, participating in the daily administrative duties involved in running an agency, and interacting with clients at meals, on outings, and during chores. Other sites request that interns accompany doctors, nurses, counselors, or social workers as they see patients and then allow the interns to use their experiences as medical students to develop projects that benefit clients.</p>

<h4>Responsibilities:</h4>

  <li>Complete a project furthering the work of the assigned site</li>

  <li>Create and present a poster about the internship experience at the Committed to Community Event at the end of the summer</li>
  <li>Maintain good academic standing with the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine</li>
</ul>

<h4>Benefits:</h4>

  <li>Gain a better understanding of the cultural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors that impact health</li>

  <li>Receive a $4,160 stipend</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to apply:</h4>
