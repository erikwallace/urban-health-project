By supporting Urban Health Project, you are providing medical students with the opportunity to gain experience in addressing the broad factors that impact health care.</p>

<p>Additionally, when you donate, you will be investing in the community by allowing our interns to provide valuable services to our partner organizations that work hard to improve the Greater Cincinnati area.</p>
